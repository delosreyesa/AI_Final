(no)\nI don't think you do, I don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause (come on, come on)\nCome on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)\nSee you deserve some applause\n'Cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say sabotage", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06841ab5a88f10a58e33ee216f92254c.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
