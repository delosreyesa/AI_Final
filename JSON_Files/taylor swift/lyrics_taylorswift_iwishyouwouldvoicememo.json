This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes \"I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds.\" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said \"Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me\". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called \"I Wish You Would\", because Jack wrote back and said \"I love that\". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:\n\nOkay so this is an idea called \"I Wish You Would\". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this\n\nIt's 2 am, in your car\nWindows down, past my street the memories start\nIt's in the past\nYou drive straight ahead\nYou thinking that I hate you now\nCause you still don't know what I never said\n\nI wish you would come back\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did\nI wish you knew that\n\nDo you like it!?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ea4242a7fd55b688a3250c706b11282.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
