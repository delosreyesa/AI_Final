Please tell me\n'Cause one second it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said \"forever and always\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest?\nMade you run and hide like a scared little boy\nI looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said \"forever and always\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\n\n[Bridge]\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nI don't think so, oh oh oh\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nPlease back up, oh back up\nBack up, baby, back up\n\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said \"forever and always\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said forever and always\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said forever and always\n\n[Outro]\nYou didn't mean it baby\nYou said forever and always, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d07c0375b6f6f703e7cdf2d3e6edf5cc.770x770x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
