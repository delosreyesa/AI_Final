{"songs": [{"title": "Reputation Tour Book Intro", "album": "Taylor Swift ", "year": "2018-06-02", "lyrics": "Here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the \"he said/she said.\" Here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things we're insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti.\n\nTo the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you.\n\nHere's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party.\n\nHere's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes. Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a \"reputation\" and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums.\n\nThanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was.\n\nLove,\nTaylor", "image": "https://images.genius.com/407887c2a6f6e60304b62134af97fc59.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
