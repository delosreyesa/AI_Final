Hey\nAll you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\n(Stay!) Hey\nNow, you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\nWell, could've been easy\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was stay\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere you are now, calling me up\nBut I don't know what to say\nI've been picking up the pieces\nOf the mess you made\nPeople like you always want back\nThe love they pushed aside\nBut people like me are gone forever\nWhen you say goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\n(Stay!) Hey\nAll you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\n(Stay!) Hey\nNow, you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\nWell, could've been easy\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)\n\n[Bridge]\nLet me remind you\nThis was what you wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\nYou ended it\nYou were all I wanted (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\nBut not like this\nNot like this\nNot like this\nOh, all you had to do was\n\n[Chorus]\n(Stay!) Hey\nAll you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?\n(Stay!) Hey\nNow, you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\nWell, could've been easy\nAll you had to do was\n(Stay!) Hey\nAll you had to do was stay\nHad me in the palm of your hand\nThen, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?\n(Stay!) Hey\nNow, you say you want it back\nNow that it's just too late\n(All you had to do was stay)\nWell, could've been easy\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!) (Oh)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)\nAll you had to do was (stay!)
