I'm doing real well\nTonight I'm hosting SNL\nBut I'm not going to brag about that\nIn my monologue\n\n[Chorus]\nLa la la, ha ha ha\nHa ha ha, ha ha ha\nLa la la\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd if you're wondering if I might\nBe dating the werewolf from Twilight\n[mouths \"Hi Taylor!\", blows him a kiss]\nI'm not going to comment on that\nIn my monologue\n\n[Chorus]\nLa la, la la la la la\nThis is my musical monologue\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou might be expecting me to say\nSomething bad about Kanye\nAnd how he ran up on the stage\nAnd ruined my VMA monologue\nBut there's nothing more to say\nCause everything's okay\nI've got security lining this stage\nThis is my SNL monologue\n\n[Chorus]\nLa la, la la la la la\nThis is my SNL monologue\nLa la, la la la la la\nThat was my SNL monologue", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7f39c39a2c39b2ae105e5e4085c97eb6.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
