Please tell me\n'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest, made you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy?\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\nYou didn't mean it baby, I don't think so\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, back up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\nOh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said forever and always\nAnd  it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said forever and always\nYou didn't mean it baby\nYou said forever and always, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/026c5c3f1618d0b001cc2a09bbcdc3cd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
