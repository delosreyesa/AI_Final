All the possibilities\nWell, I was wrong\n\n[Chorus 1: Hayley Williams with (Taylor Swift)]\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)\nI drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating\nAnd that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)\n\n[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]\nI wonder\nHow am I supposed to feel when you're not here?\nCause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here\nI still try holding onto silly things, I never learn\nOh, why?\nAll the possibilities\nI'm sure you've heard\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift with (Hayley Williams)]\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)\nI drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating\nAnd that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)\n\n[Bridge: Hayley Williams]\nPain, make your way to me, to me\nAnd I'll always be just so inviting\nIf I ever start to think straight\nThis heart will start a riot in me\nLet's start, start, hey!\n\n[Breakdown: Taylor Swift and Hayley Williams]\nWhy do we like to hurt so much?\nOh, why do we like to hurt so much?\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, woah\n\n[Chorus: Hayley Williams and Taylor Swift]\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, woah\nThat's what you get when you let your heart win, woah\nNow, I can't trust myself with anything but this\nAnd that's what you get when you let your heart win, woah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
