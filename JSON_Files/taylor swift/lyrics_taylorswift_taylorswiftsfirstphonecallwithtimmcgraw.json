And what what did you think the first time you heard it?\nOr how was the first time?\nTim:\nIt was awesome. Uh except for I didn't know if I should I should take it\nAs a compliment or I should feel old\nDJ:\nA ha ha ha\nTim:\nI didn't know which one but the more\nThe more I hear it the more...I don't know if its true or not\nBut I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old\nI don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think\nDJ:\nWhy don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?\nTaylor:\nOh its definitely a compliment. Yeah\n(Laughing)\nDJ:\nTim McGraw meet Taylor Swift\nTim:\nNice-\nTaylor:\nNice to meet you\nTim:\nNice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?\nTaylor:\nI'm doing great. How are you doing?\nTim:\nI'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great\nTaylor:\nThank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good\nMusic and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker\n(laughing)\nDJ:\nWell-\nTaylor:\nThe funny thing about this song is ya know\nAs a writer some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll\nDo them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but\nI wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really\nDidn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so\nI kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it\nWas going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like\nWe're putting that out\n(laughing)\nTim:\nWell I'm glad ya did cuz um it's doing well for ya\nDJ:\nSo I-\nSo I understand that you two guys have not talked\nTim:\nNo\nDJ:\nYou haven't met\nTim:\nNo\nTaylor:\nNo, we've never talked or met or anything\nTim:\nI sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly\nOr something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was\nI was doing an interview and they were going to interview\nTaylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message\nSo, I don't know if she got it or not\nTaylor:\nOh my God. They never gave that to me\nTim:\nThey didn't? Ok well, there ya go. I did\n(laughing)\nDJ:\nSo I-I\nTaylor:\nWe've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything\nTim:\nNot at all\nDJ:\nSo I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called\nTim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?\nTaylor:\nIt was definitely kind of a chance\nYa know I did say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking\nYa know, he wouldn't take it too bad\nTim:\nWell, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad\nI'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-\nTaylor:\nCould you tell Faith that I said hello?\nTim:\nI sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way\nTaylor:\nOh my gosh, she's awesome\nTim:\nI agree\nDJ:\nThis, this...Tell me about writing a song\nUm did this, did this really happen?\nTaylor:\nWell, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing\nSession on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw\nUm, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nI actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the\nMelody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year\nOf high school\nTim:\nNow I feel old\nTaylor:\nAnd um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself\nAnd I was going through a period where I was dating this guy\nThat was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up\nSo I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind\nHim of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya\nKnow that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are\nTim:\nAww, thank you\nTaylor:\nAnd uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first\nAnd so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano\nAnd wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering\nIf I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know\nThe funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and\nNever never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it\nAnd uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it\nFor my record label president and he goes \"well thats your first single\"\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nAnd I'm like well\nTim:\nWell you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nThats awesome. There's a part two coming out next month\nTim:\nAlright, great\n(laughing)\nTim:\nWell congratulations cuz its your first single\nFirst top ten hit and thats pretty exciting\nAnd I know you're off to the races here\nYou're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you\nTaylor:\nAwesome, its been so exciting\nTim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?\nTim:\nUm I dont know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nWell I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it\nTim:\nYa do? What would-\nTaylor:\nYeah\nTim:\nWhat would their name be?\nTaylor:\nUh, um I think Taylor something\nTim:\nSomething like that yeah\nTaylor:\nBut\nTim:\nWell I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me\nTaylor:\nJust consider it\nDJ:\nAh, well thats very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift\nI'll tell ya that\nTim:\nRight she's, she's gonna be forward this time\nDJ:\nI think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well\nTim:\nAbsolutely\nDJ:\nHey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us\nTaylor:\nIt was awesome and thank you.
