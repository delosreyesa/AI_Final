{"songs": [{"title": "Blank Space (Voice Memo)", "album": "1989", "year": "2014-10-27", "lyrics": "So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called \"Blank Space,\" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the \"Oh!\" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called \"Blank Space.\"\n\n\"Nice to meet you, where you been?\nI could show you incredible things\nDiamonds, seasides, all those things\n[?] this song that [?]\nLike, oh my God, listen in\nListen in, I do too\n[?]\n[?] honest [?]\nWe can [?]\n[All you're?] thinking, all this time\n[?]\nOh my God, [?] me\nJust forget what you've heard about me\nDon't believe what you hear about me, hear about me\n'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go -\nYeah! Hey, hey!\nGonna go down in flames\nYou can tell me when it's over -\nThis is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track\nLong list of ex-love -\nGot a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\n*Click* I'll write your name\nI've got a blank space, baby\n*Click* I'll write your name\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ea4242a7fd55b688a3250c706b11282.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
