I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby just say yes\"\n\n[Bridge]\n\nOh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night\nI'm the one who makes you laugh\nWhen you know you're about to cry\nAnd I know your favorite songs\nAnd you tell me about your dreams\nI think I know where you belong\nI think I know it's with me\nCan't you see that I'm the one who understands you\nBeen here all along so why can't you see\nYou belong with me\n\n[Chorus]\n\nStanding by and waiting at your back door\nAll this time\nHow could you not know\nBaby you belong with me\nYou belong with me\nYou belong with me\nHave you ever thought just maybe\nYou belong with me\nYou belong with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43b1d2b6d6ee95e6ea9207bfa8fe43f0.1000x677x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
