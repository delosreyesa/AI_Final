It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot \u2018approve\u2019 a song you haven\u2019t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
