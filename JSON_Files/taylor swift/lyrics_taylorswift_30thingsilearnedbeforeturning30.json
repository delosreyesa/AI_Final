{"songs": [{"title": "30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30", "album": null, "year": "2019-03-06", "lyrics": "According to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are \"the most fun!\" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring.\n\nLesson 1\n\nI learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren\u2019t, how you\u2019re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I\u2019m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I\u2019m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. I\u2019m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to \u201cgo die in a hole ho\u201d while I\u2019m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it\u2019s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.\n\nLesson 2\n\nBeing sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life\u2019s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake\u2014only bite if someone steps on you.\n\nLesson 3\n\nTrying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it\u2019s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It\u2019s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That\u2019s GOOD. We\u2019ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That\u2019s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you\u2019ll learn from it. Then you\u2019ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it\u2019s fine; do you, you\u2019re searching.\n\nLesson 4\n\nI learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.\n\nLesson 5\n\nBanish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn\u2019t cruel. It\u2019s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.\n\nLesson 6\n\nI\u2019ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren\u2019t allowed to age. It\u2019s an impossible standard to meet, and I\u2019ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we\u2019re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn\u2019t even remotely required of men.\n\nLesson 7\n\nMy biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn\u2019t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I\u2019ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I\u2019ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\n\nLesson 8\n\nI learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was \u201ccouples goals\u201d based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn\u2019t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.\n\nLesson 9\n\nI learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm\u2019s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because\u20262016.\n\nLesson 10\n\nI\u2019ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I\u2019ll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten\u2019s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson\u2019s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Chicken Fajitas with Mol\u00e9 Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I\u2019m pretty sure the internet would call a \u201cweird flex.\u201d)\n\nLesson 11\n\nRecently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I\u2019d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.\n\nLesson 12\n\nApologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it\u2019s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but...\u201d and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.\n\nLesson 13\n\nIt\u2019s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying \u201cThis happened to me.\u201d It\u2019s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don\u2019t.\n\nLesson 14\n\nWhen tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you\u2019ve never dealt with before, it\u2019s okay to say that you don\u2019t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you\u2019re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It\u2019s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don\u2019t have all the answers. However, it\u2019s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they\u2019re at their lowest point. Even if you can\u2019t really help the situation, it\u2019s nice for them to know that you would if you could.\n\nLesson 15\n\nVitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.\n\nLesson 16\n\nBefore you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don\u2019t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn\u2019t gold, and first impressions actually aren\u2019t everything. It\u2019s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a \u201csolid first 15\u201d), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they\u2019ve seen you broken? Or after they\u2019ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they\u2019re people? These are things a first impression could never convey.\n\nLesson 17\n\nAfter my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can\u2019t I be soft during all the seasons?!\n\nLesson 18\n\nRealizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It\u2019s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.\n\nLesson 19\n\nPlaying mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot if you don\u2019t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.\n\nLesson 20\n\nLearning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about \u201cwe\u2019re in our young twenties!\u201d hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they\u2019ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It\u2019s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you\u2019ll always keep the memories.\n\nLesson 21\n\nFashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don\u2019t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you\u2019re doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.\n\nLesson 22\n\nHow to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you\u2019re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren\u2019t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there\u2019s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who \u201cwon\u201d the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say \u201cHey, same team.\u201d Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don\u2019t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.\n\nLesson 23\n\nI learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don\u2019t care if I\u2019m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they\u2019re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I\u2019ll never forget the ones who stuck around.\n\nLesson 24\n\nI\u2019ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It\u2019s taught me that there are real problems and then there\u2019s everything else. My mom\u2019s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.\n\nLesson 25\n\nI remember people asking me, \u201cWhat are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?\u201d There\u2019s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I\u2019m really grateful to have learned this isn\u2019t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.\n\nLesson 26\n\nI make countdowns for things I\u2019m excited about. When I\u2019ve gone through dark, low times, I\u2019ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they\u2019re free) and adding things I\u2019m looking forward to. Even if they\u2019re not big holidays or anything, it\u2019s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it\u2019s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.\n\nLesson 27\n\nI learned that disarming someone\u2019s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I\u2019ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life, but I can\u2019t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It\u2019s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll\u2019s hateful Instagram comment with \u201clol.\u201d It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I\u2019ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.\n\nLesson 28\n\nI\u2019m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I\u2019m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.\n\nLesson 29\n\nI learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It\u2019s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they\u2019ve left me. Please pray for their safe return.\n\nLesson 30\n\nMy mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I\u2019d lock myself in my room and couldn\u2019t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I\u2019ve made a mistake, whether it\u2019s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I\u2019ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
