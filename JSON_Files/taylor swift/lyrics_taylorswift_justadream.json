No one knows\nI realize it was only just a dream\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nI was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement\nNumber one spot and now she find her a replacement\nI swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby\nAnd now you ain't around, baby, I can't think\nI should've put it down, should've got the ring\n'Cause I can still feel it in the air\nSee her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair\n\n[Pre-Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]\nMy lover, my life, my shawty, my wife\nShe left me, I'm tied\n'Cause I knew that it just ain't right\n\n[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]\nI was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me\nThinking 'bout us, what we gon' be\nOpen my eyes\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travelled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize it was only just a dream\n\n[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]\nWhen I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn\nTryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn\nAnd I just hope she know that she's the only one I yearn for\nMore and more I miss her. When will I learn?\nDidn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback\nNow I'm in the club thinking all about my baby\nHey, she was so easy to love\nBut wait, I guess that love wasn't enough\nI'm going through it every time that I'm alone\nAnd now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone\nBut she made the decision that she wanted to move on\n'Cause I was wrong\n\n[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]\nI was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me\nThinking 'bout us, what we gon' be\nOpen my eyes\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travelled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize it was only just a dream\n\n[Bridge: Nelly\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nAnd now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything\nSaid if you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nIf you ever loved somebody put your hands up\nNow they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything\n\n[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]\nI was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me\nThinking 'bout us, what we gon' be\nOpen my eyes\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travelled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize it was only just a dream\n\n[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]\nI was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me\nThinking 'bout us, what we gon' be\nOpen my eyes\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travelled back down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize it was only just a dream", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
