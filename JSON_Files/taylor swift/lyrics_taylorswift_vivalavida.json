Long live the king!\u201d\n\nOne minute I held the keys\nNext the doors were closed on me\nAnd I discovered that my castles stand\nUpon pillars of salt, pillars of sand\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nOnce you go there was never\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\n\nIt was a wicked and wild wind\nBlew down the doors to let me in\nShattered windows and the sound of drums\nPeople couldn't believe what I'd become\n\nRevolutionaries wait\nFor my head on a silver plate\nJust a puppet on a lonely string\nOh who would ever wanna be king?\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Peter won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Peter won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
