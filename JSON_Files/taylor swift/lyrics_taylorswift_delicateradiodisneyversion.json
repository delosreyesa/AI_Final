Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nDelicate\n\nThird floor on the West Side, me and you\nHandsome, your mansion with a view\nDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\nLong night, with your hands up in my hair\nEchoes of your footsteps on the stairs\nStay here, honey, I don't wanna share\n\n'Cause I like you\nThis ain't for the best\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\nYou must like me for me\nYeah, I want you\nWe can't make\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\nBut you can make me a drink\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\nIs it cool that I said all that\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\nDelicate\n\nSometimes I wonder when you sleep\nAre you ever dreaming of me?\nSometimes when I look into your eyes\nI pretend you're mine, all the  time\n\n'Cause I like you\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\nYeah, I want you\nIs it cool that I said all that\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n'Cause I like you\nIs it cool that I said all that?\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\nYeah, I want you\nIs it cool that I said all that\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\nDelicate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c96b556734c287325d3ca26d65afcae3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
