Is she's standing on the sidelines?\nOh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow we're standing in the ring\nAnd you make the first swing\nAnd now I'm fighting dirty\nBut I ain't going down till they break it up\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I used to be on your side\nNow it's looking like we're going to battle\nAnd why you're taking shots at me like\nSomebody's gonna give you a medal?\nAnd I never wanna hurt you\nBut I'm tired of taking all these blows\nAnd so I'd rather be on your side\nBut if you wanna fight\nLet's go, oh, oh\nLet's go, oh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nNow we're standing in the ring\nBreaking everything that we've been building up so long\nAnd I don't wanna do this break it up\nBut you're not who I thought you were\nAnd this is looking more like a war\nLooks like we're going to war\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd I used to be on your side\nNow it's looking like we're going to battle\nAnd I try to not break down crying\nNo one's gonna give you a medal\nAnd I never wanna hurt you\nBut I'm tired of taking all these blows\nAnd so I'd rather be on your side\nI'd rather be on your side\nBut if you wanna fight\nBaby let's go, oh, oh\nLooks like we're going to war\nOh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nThe first shots fired\nEverybody's gathered around\nYou're looking at me like I try to take you down\nNo, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6abc3bd9585f8d4be0164b0784b70cfd.770x770x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
