On our last night\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh\nI remember waking up with you\nThe days doing nothing\nYou meant more to me then, than you ever knew\nYou were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar\nHope the the world never tore that out of you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTell me whatever happened to the things you loved?\nAnd the songs we played and the Indian days\nWhatever happened to the things you gave away?\nLike Harold and martin singing\n\nI was waving as you drove away\nThe sunlight was falling\nYou were riding backwards in a dusty window pane\n\n[Chorus]\nAngels fly in the air tonight\nWas it just like the promises that we made?\nAnd stars collide in the air so light\nWas it just like those promises that you made?\nOn our last night\nOn our last night\nOh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
