Everybody's joking now\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over\u2014blaow!\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\n\nYou make me smile like the sun\nFall outta bed\nSing like a bird\nDizzy in my head\nSpin like a record\nCrazy on a Sunday night\nYou make me dance like a fool\nForget how to breathe\nShine like gold\nBuzz like a bee\nJust the thought of you can drive me wild\nOh, you make me smile", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
