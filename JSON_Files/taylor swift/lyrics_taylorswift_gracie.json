Johnson\nThat's her daddy's name\nHe's been overseas\nIt'll be a year today\nHe never talked about being scared over the phone\nHe just said me and Gracie will come and take him on\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd the people that we meet\nAs we go through the rain\nThere are no accidents in what we do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f97374165df3dd8060f854cbfca1d16e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
