Hey ya!\nHey ya! Hey ya!\nHey ya! Hey ya!\nHey ya! Hey ya!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it\nBut \"got it\" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all\nWe've been together, oh, we've been together\nBut separate's always better when there's feelings involved\nIf what they say is \"Nothing is forever\"\nThen what makes, then what makes, then what makes\nThen what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?\nSo why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh\nAre we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?\n\n[Chorus]\nHey ya! (oh, oh) Hey ya!\nDon't want to meet your daddy\nJust want you in my caddy\nHey ya! Hey ya!\nDon't want to meet your momma\nJust want to make you cum-a\nI'm, I'm, I'm just being honest!\nI'm just being honest!\n\n[Bridge]\nAlright! Pick it up, here we go now!\nShake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it\nShake it, shake it, shake it, shake it\nShake it like a Polaroid picture!\n\nShake it, shake it, shake it, shake it\nShake it, shake it, shake it, shake it\nShake it like a Polaroid\n\n[Outro]\nHey ya! Hey ya! (oh, oh)\nHey ya! Hey ya!\nHey ya! (oh, oh) Hey ya!\nHey ya! Hey ya!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b93a92e165cb5775ef799882d79f1a8.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
