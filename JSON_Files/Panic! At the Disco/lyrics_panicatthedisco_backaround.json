Who'd you be? Who'd you be?)\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat is it gonna take\nTo make your car break down\nAnd realize mistake's repairable\nYou can turn it back around, around\nAround, around\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, I'm alright\nNothing's wrong and I don't need any help\nNo, It's not okay, I'm fine\nBut you do this to yourself\nOkay, you got your way\nI'm not wasting any time on this\nI'll be waiting at the start of your life\nWhen you turn it back around\nAround (When you turn it back)\nAround (When you turn it back)\nAround (When you turn it back)\nAround (It doesn't matter what you say or think)\nAround (When the words are faked with ?)\nAround (What were left, what were left, what were left?)\nAround (Who'd you be?
