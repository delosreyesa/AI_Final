Hey!) If crazy equals genius\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius\nThen I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)\nI'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...\n\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)\nBut you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)\nBut you're never gonna learn, learn, learn\n(Hey!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said, \"Darlin', you know\nHow the wine plays tricks on my tongue\nBut you don't seem to change\nWhen you stuff all of your feelings with drugs\"\nOther boys you may have dated\nSerrated your heart with a slice\nBut the cut of your love never hurts\nBaby, it's a sweet butter knife\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe said, \"You're just like Mike Love\nBut you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson\"\nSaid, \"You're just like Mike Love\nBut you'll never be Dennis Wilson\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius\nThen I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)\nI'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...\n\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)\nBut you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)\nBut you're never gonna learn, learn, learn\n(Hey!)\n\n[Bridge]\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey!)\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey!)\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey!)\nYou can set yourself on fire\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius\nThen I'm a fucking arsonist (Hey!)\nI'm a rocket scientist (Hey! Hey!)\n(Hey! Hey!) If crazy equals genius...\n\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey! Hey!)\nBut you're never gonna burn, burn, burn (Hey! Hey!)\nYou can set yourself on fire (Hey!
