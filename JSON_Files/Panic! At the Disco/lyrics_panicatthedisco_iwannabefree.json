I can feel its vital signs\nThe beat goes dry, and the spirit dies (oh)\nI want to dig this Tinseltown 'til it's six feet underground\nIt's safe to say that timing is everything (is everything)\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be free, I wanna be loved\nI wanna be more than you're thinking of\nEverything seems to be estranged when you're alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlayed our parts and covered ground\nDrowned our sorrows\nLaid them down\nMy memory is keeping the effigy\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be free, I wanna be loved\nI wanna be more than you're thinking of\nEverything seems to be estranged when you're alone (oh)\n\n[Bridge]\nOne day I will stop keeping track\nAnd give myself time to react\nOne day\nOne day\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna be free, I wanna be loved\nI wanna be more than you're thinking of\nEverything seems to be estranged when you're alone\n\n[Chorus]\nWanna be free, wanna be loved\nWanna be more than you're thinking of\nEverything seems to be estranged when you're alone\n(Oh! Yeah!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ce8dd4075413cd862747fd30e1598c55.639x639x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
