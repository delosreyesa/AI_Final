I am out of my mind\nThrowing a line out to sea to see if I can catch a dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe sun was always in her eyes\nShe didn't even see me\nBut that girl had so much love\nShe'd wanna kiss you all the time\nYeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time\n\nShe said she'd won the world at a carnival\nBut I'm sure I didn't ruin her\nJust made her more interesting\nI'm sure I didn't ruin her\nJust made her more interesting\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I know why\nBecause when I look in her eyes, I just see the sky\nWhen I look in her eyes\nWell, I just see the sky\n\n[Chorus: Ryan Ross]\nI don't love you, I'm just passing the time\nYou could love me if I knew how to lie\nBut who could love me?
