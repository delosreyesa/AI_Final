I am not of\nRags or of scraps. Pristine\u2026\n(I am something velveteen)\nAnd I'll be like something velveteen\nThe charcoal clouds have finally\nFinished spitting on me\nConcentrating instead on painting a\nFaithful portrait splashed across\nThe canvas of the wine read heavens\nYou are draped across a vast daffodil cream", "image": "https://images.genius.com/03a343caac669ceb17d547ac85f44c88.653x467x1.png"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
