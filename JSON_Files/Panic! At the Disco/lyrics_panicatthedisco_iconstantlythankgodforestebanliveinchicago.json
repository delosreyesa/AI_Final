Now don't you move\n\nStrike up the band\nWhoa, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, and let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it don't you get it? Now don't you move\n\nJust stay where I can see you\nDouse the lights\n\nWe sure are in for a show tonight\n\nIn this little number, we are graced by two displays of character\nWe've got: the gunslinger extraordinaire, a walking contradiction\nAnd I for one can see no blood\nFrom the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit\nAnd I for one won't stand for this\nIf the scene were a parish, you'd all be condemned\n\nStrike up the band\nWhoa, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, and let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it don't you get it? Now don't you move\n\nStrike up the band\nWhoa, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, and let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it don't you get it? Now don't you, don't you move\n\nJust stay where I can see you\nDouse the lights\nWe sure are in for a show tonight\n\nJust stay where I can see you\nDouse the lights\nWe sure are in for a show tonight\n\nJust stay where I can see you\nDouse the lights\nLa da ta ta, la da ta ta, la da ta ta....\n\nStrike up the band\nWhoa, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, and let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it, don't you get it? Now don't you move\n\nStrike up the band\nWhoa, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, and let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it don't you get it?
