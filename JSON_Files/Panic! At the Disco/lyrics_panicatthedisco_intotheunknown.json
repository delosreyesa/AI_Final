'Cause you've been keeping me awake\nAre you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?\nOr are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?\nWho knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?\nEvery day's a little harder as I feel your power grow\nDon't you know there's part of me that longs to go\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nInto the unknown?\nInto the unknown\nInto the unknown\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAh ah ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah ah\nOh oh oh\n\n[Bridge]\nAre you out there?\nDo you know me?\nCan you feel me?\nCan you show me?\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\nAh ah ah ah\n\n[Outro]\nWhere are you going?\nDon't leave me alone\nHow do I follow you\nInto the unknown?\nWhoo!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/be887b320e912f6fc6b92f11d955e987.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
