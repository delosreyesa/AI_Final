Hey! We are a hurricane\nDrop our anchors in a storm\nHey! They will never be the same\nA fire in a flask to keep us warm\n'Cause they know, I know\nThat they don't look like me\nOh, they know, I know\nThat they don't sound like me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou'll dance to anything!\nYou'll dance to anything!\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I'd confess, I'd confess\nIn a room where I\u2019m blessed\nBut he didn't come and speak to me\nOr put my heart at ease\nAnd I believe that half the time\nI am a wolf among the sheep\nGnawing at the wool over my eyes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI led the revolution in my bedroom\nAnd I set all the zippers free\nWe said, \"No more war, no more clothes!\nGive me peace!\nOh, kiss me!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Hey! We are a hurricane\nDrop our anchors in a storm\nHey! They will never be the same\nA fire in a flask to keep us warm\n'Cause they know, I know\nThat they don't look like me\nOh, they know, I know\nThat they don't sound like me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou'll dance to anything!\nYou'll dance to anything!\nYou'll dance to anything!\nYou'll dance to anything!\n\n[Bridge]\nFix me or conflict me\nI'll take anything\nFix me or just conflict me\n'Cause I'll take anything\n\n[Chorus]\nHey! Hey! We are a hurricane\nDrop our anchors in a storm\nHey! They will never be the same\nA fire in a flask to keep us warm\n'Cause they know, I know\nThat they don't look like me\nOh, they know, I know\nThat they don't sound like me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou'll dance to anything!\nYou'll dance to anything!\n\n[Instrumental Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51b31f8a235bbefc235d302f3a486870.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
