Watch me, watch my fingers. Here we go, ready? Watch me\nD\u00e8s le premier jour, ton parfum enivra mon amour\nEt dans ces instants\nJ'aimerais \u00eatre comme toi par moments\nMais depuis ce jour\nJe n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy wing tips waltz across naive\nWood floors, they creak\nInnocently down the stairs\nDrag melody\nMy percussive feet serve cobweb headaches as a\nMatching set of marching clocks\nThe slumbering apparitions\nThat they've come to wake up\nHere I am composing a burlesque\nOut of where they rest their necks\nSunken in their splintered cradles\nAnd ramshackle heads\nThey asked for it\nAs a girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou have set your heart\nOn haunting me forever\nFrom the start\nIt's never silent\n\n[Chorus]\nEver since we met\nI only shoot up with your perfume\nIt's the only thing\nThat makes me feel as good as you do\nEver since we met\nI've got just one regret to live through\nAnd that one regret is you\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow does a heart love if no one has noticed its presence\nAnd where does it go?\nTrembling hands play my heart like a drum\nBut the beat's gotten lost in the show\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou have set your heart\nOn haunting me forever\nFrom the start\nIt's never silent\n\n[Chorus]\nEver since we met\nI only shoot up with your perfume\nIt's the only thing\nThat makes me feel as good as you do\nEver since we met\nI've got just one regret to live through\nAnd I regret never letting you go\nEver since we met\nI only shoot up with your perfume\nIt's the only thing\nThat makes me feel as good as you do\nEver since we met\nI've got just one regret to live through\nAnd that one regret is you\n\n[Outro]\nMona Lisa, pleased to please you\n(And that one regret is you)\nMona Lisa, pleased to please you\n(And that one regret is you)\nMona Lisa, pleased to please you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51b31f8a235bbefc235d302f3a486870.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
