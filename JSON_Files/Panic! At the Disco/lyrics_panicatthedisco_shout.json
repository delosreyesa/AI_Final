I have a confession to make: you guys are my pilates, ok? This is the best workout I've ever had in my life.\u200b Wooh! And I still get to drink beer, that's amazing.\u200b That's the best workout of the world, I'm glad this isn't international.\u200b\nI think that's Gatorade.\u200b\nThat isn't that (?), is that what you said?\nNo, it's Gatorade.\u200b\n...Oh shit, woops. Well I'm wrong... again. Alright! So how many the people in the house that haven't seen Animal House (a classic), thank God! Thank God! Alright! If you're willing, right now, get down to knee level, like [?], like this. If you're down.\u200b You don't have to do it, I'll probably be the only one, it's okay, it's not the first time. Then you're down like this and the next two minutes, it's gonna get fucking crazy, and what I mean by fucking crazy is you have to move, dance, scream or whatever you want to do, alright? If you don't wanna dance and you're like \"Oh, I'm not a dancer\", that's bullshit and I'll be telling you, I'm gonna show you three dances right now, one is right here, you just go side to side. People will say that's not a dance move but fuck them because that's an awesome dance move. If you don't want to do that : like this. And if that's not your bag, you just do this: it's a little two step from back in the day. Alright! Spencer, please bring us back here.\u200b\n\n[Bridge]\nA little bit louder now, a little bit louder now\nA little bit louder now\n(shout) A little bit louder now, (shout) A little bit louder now\n(shout) A little bit louder now, (shout) A little bit louder now\n(shout) A little bit louder now, (shout)\n(shout) (shout)\nHey (Hey), Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey)\nHey (Hey), Hey (Hey), Hey (Hey), Hey\n\n[Outro]\nYou make me wanna shout", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2431d01fa7079cef1514c7b91d243f1.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
