Just grab on to some\n\n[Chorus]\nDuck Tales (woo oo)\nEveryday they're out there making\nDuck Tales (woo oo)\nTales of derring-do, bad and good\nDuck Tales (woo oo)\nNot pony tails or cottontails\nNo, Duck Tales (woo oo)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2431d01fa7079cef1514c7b91d243f1.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
