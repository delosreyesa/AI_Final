Don't you get it?\nNow, don't you move\n\nStrike up the band!\nWhoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it?\nNow, don't you move\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nJust stay where I can see you, douse the lights!\nWe sure are in for a show, tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn this little number\nWe're graced by two displays of character\nWe've got the gunslinger extraordinaire\nA walking contradiction\n\nAnd I, for one, can see no blood\nFrom the hearts and the wrists you allegedly slit\nAnd I, for one, won't stand for this\nIf this scene were a parish, you'd all be condemned\n\n[Chorus]\nStrike up the band!\nWhoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it?\nNow, don't you move\n\nStrike up the band!\nWhoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it?\nNow, don't you, don't you move\n\n[Bridge]\nJust stay where I can see you, douse the lights\nWe sure are in for a show, tonight!\nJust stay where I can see you, douse the lights!\nWe sure are in for a show, tonight!\nStay where I can see you, douse the lights!\n\n[Chorus]\nStrike up the band!\nWhoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it?\nNow, don't you move\n\nStrike up the band!\nWhoa-oh, the conductor is beckoning\nCome congregation, let's sing it like you mean it\nNo, don't you get it? Don't you get it?\nNow, don't you move\nDon't you move\n\n[Outro]\nDon't you move...\nStrike up the band!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea07e7fd262aa75dc5ca0ca6d47b7a9f.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
