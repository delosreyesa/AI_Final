(pirate love)\nSometimes pirate love...\nIs the only love we...\n\n[Verse 3: Brendon Urie and Kenneth Harris]\nI'm swabbing your deck\nYou're walking my plank\nSwabbing your poop deck\nI'll swab your deck if you walk my plank\nYou can call me Timmy and I'll call you Hank\n\n[Chorus: Brendon Urie]\nWe'll be pirates together (pirates together)\nWe'll be pirates together (pirates together)\nWe'll go robbing, pillaging plunder forever\nYou and me can be pirates together\n\n[Verse 4: Brendon Urie (impersonating Bryan Adams]\nLooking for your sunken treasure\n\n[Soul Asylum - Runaway Train cover: Brendon Urie]\nWe're pirates and we're just best friends\n(?)\n(Something) walk my plank and I'll swab your poop deck\nNo, no, pirates are my best friends\n(?)
