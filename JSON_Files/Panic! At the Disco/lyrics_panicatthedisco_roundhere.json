I don't know\nMaria says she's dying\nThrough the door I hear her crying\nWhy? I don't know\n\n[Chorus]\nRound here we always stand up straight\nRound here something radiates\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand\nShe said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis\nShe walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land\nIt's like she's walking on a wire in the circus\nShe parks her car outside of my house\nTakes her clothes off\nSays she's close to understanding Jesus\nAnd she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood\nShe has trouble acting normal when she's nervous\n\n[Chorus]\nRound here we're carving out our names\nRound here we all look the same\nRound here we talk just like lions but we sacrifice like lambs\nRound here she's slipping through my hands\n\n[Verse 3]\nOhhh\nSleeping children better run like the wind\nOut of the lightning dream\nMama's little baby better get herself in\nOut of the lightning\n\nShe says \"it's only in my head\"\nShe says \"Shhh! I know it's only in my head\"\nShe said \"did you think that you were dreaming?\"\nI said \"no\"\n\"Did you think that you were dreaming\"\nI said \"no\"\n\"Did you think that you were dreaming\"\nI said \"sometimes I don't know\"\n\nThere's a girl on the car out in the parking lot\nAnd she says \"come on, ya know come on just take a shot\nCan't you see me\nCan't you see me\nCan't you see my walls are tumbling down?\nCan't you see my walls are crumbling down?\nCan't you see my sun stop spinning around\nCan't you see the sky turn black and brown\nCan't you see the moon is flashing round\nCan't you see me\nCan't you see me\nCan't you see me\nNo\n\nThere's a girl on the car out in the parking lot\nSays \"Man, you should try to take a shot\n\"Can't you see my walls are crumbling down?\"\nThen she looks up at the building\nSays she's thinking of jumping\nShe says she's tired of life\nShe must be tired of something\n\n[Chorus]\nRound here she's always on my mind\nRound here, hey man, got lots of time\nRound here we're never sent to bed early and nobody makes us wait\nRound here we stay up very, very, very, very late\n\n[Outro]\nI can't see nothing, nothing round here\nSo will you catch if I'm falling\nWill you catch me if I'm falling\nWill you catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you\nI said I'm under the gun round here\nMan I said I'm under the gun round here\nBut I can't see nothing\nNothing round here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2431d01fa7079cef1514c7b91d243f1.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
