Divine intervention\nI want to be praised from a new perspective\nBut leaving now would be a good idea\nSo catch me up on getting out of here\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan we fast-forward til you go down on me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nTaking everything for granted\nBut we still respect the time\nWe move along with some new passion\nKnowing everything is fine (Everything is fine)\nAnd I would wait and watch the hours fall\nIn a hundred separate lines\nBut I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan we fast-forward til you go down on me?\n\n[Chorus]\nStop there and let me correct it\nI want to live a life from a new perspective\nYou come along because I love your face\nAnd I'll admire your expensive taste\nAnd who cares? Divine intervention\nI want to be praised from a new perspective\nBut leaving now would be a good idea\nSo catch me up on getting out of here\nCatch me up on getting out of here\n\n[Bridge]\nMore to the point, I need to show\nHow much I can come and go\nOther plans fell through\nAnd put a heavy load on you\nI know there's no more that need be said\nWhen I'm inching through your bed\nTake a look around instead and watch me go\n\n[Chorus]\nStop there and let me correct it\nI want to live a life from a new perspective\nYou come along because I love your face\nAnd I'll admire your expensive taste\nAnd who cares? Divine intervention\nI want to be praised from a new perspective\nBut leaving now would be a good idea\nSo catch me up on getting out of here\nIt's not fair, just let me perfect it\nDon't want to live a life that is comprehensive\n'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea\nNow catch me up on getting out of here\nSo catch me up, I'm getting out of here\n\n[Outro]\nG-g-go down on me\nCan we fast-forward til you go d-d-d-d-down?", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/4f6b2d14e5a1c96af9ad19f6d3aa9ff6.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
