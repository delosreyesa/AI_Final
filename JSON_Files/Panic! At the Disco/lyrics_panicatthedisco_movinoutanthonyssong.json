I would clean the toilet most of the time --- that's okay, that's alright, look at me now, bro! Haha, I still clean his toilet, it's alright. Uh, anyways, my parents, they would make us clean the house, but the good thing, the saving grace, was that they would play records all the time. They'd play Journey, Phil Collins, oh my god, it was just ridiculous. But there was one guy, one guy who caught my ear at a very young age. His name was Billy Joel. Now, this man, this man is a legend, a god among men. We're gonna do this song. One, two, three, four!\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnthony works in the grocery store\nSavin' his pennies for someday\nMama Leone left a note on the door\nShe said \"Sonny, move out to the country\"\nBut workin' too hard can give you\nA heart attack\nYou oughta know by now\nWho needs a house out in Hackensack\nIs that all you get for your money\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it seems such a waste of time\nWell that's what it's all about\nMama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out\nI'm movin' out\nOoh, oh oh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nSergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat\nAt night he becomes a bartender\nHe works at Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street\nAcross from the medical center\nOh and he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac\nYou oughta know by now\nAnd if he can't drive with a broken back\nAt least he can polish the fenders\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd if that's what you had in mind\nIf that's what it's all about\nMama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out\nOh, movin' out\nOoh, oh oh, ooh\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou should never argue with a crazy mind\nYou oughta know by now\nYou can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime\nIs that all you get for your money\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it seems such a waste of time\nYeah, but that's what it's all about\nMama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out\nOh, movin' out, haha\nOoh, oh oh, ooh\n\n[Outro]\nI'm movin' out\nI am\nI'm movin' out\nOh yeah\nOh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fb1502b6667358f46bc71e91d1bfb39.1000x997x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Panic! at the Disco"}
