(Oh)\nSo magical\nWish I could flick and wave a wand\nGet everything that I ever wanted\nAnd put a spell on you\nAnd make it all come true\n\n[Chorus]\nWish I could put a spell on you\nWish I could make you feel like I do\nWouldn't that be sweet?\nSo magical\nWish I could flick and wave a wand\nGet everything that I ever wanted\nAnd put a spell on you\nAnd make it all come true", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f581639a9cf17ec3d0a16f84ec339925.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Selena Gomez"}
