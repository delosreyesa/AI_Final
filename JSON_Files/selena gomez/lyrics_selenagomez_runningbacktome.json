We had the nights were I slept\u2005on\u2005the coach while\u2005you slept in the kitchen. But\u2005worst of all, you've cheated multiple times and I'm faded. Now you see me gone. Now you see how tired I was of you\nSo don't be, coming back to me. After seeing how I am. Cause I hope you know my response\nNo, don't be running back to me. I don't wanna be, your lover. No, I don't wanna see you anymore. I don't wanna play your games\n\n\n\nCAUTION:THIS IS A LEAKED VERSE AND PART OF A CHORUS OFF HER UPCOMING ALBUM WHICH IS BEING DEBATED TO BE TITLED BETWEEN Selena or Lose You To Love Me.
