(Feel me)\nNights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)\nHeartbeat a little bit louder?\nHah-ah-ah-ah-oh (Feel me)\nDays get a little bit longer? (Feel me)\nNights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)\nHeartbeat a little bit louder?\nHah-ah-ah-ah-oh\n\n[Outro]\nEvery time your lips touch another\nHah-ah-ah-ah-oh\nEvery time you dance with somebody", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ebada71d502c0a63d1a407815111b163.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Selena Gomez"}
