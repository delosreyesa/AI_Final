Can I try it, too?\nI know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too\nI wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWith the smell of her perfume\nI could love her, too, like you, like you\nAnd I can almost hear her laugh\nCurving on her back for you, for you\n\n[Chorus]\nI can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest\nI can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips\nMaybe I should be more like her\nMaybe I should be more like her\nI can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too\nAnd she's perfect\n\n[Bridge]\nI can see her body rushing into you\nCrashing on your skin\nBurning within, burning so deep, deep\nOn your skin, skin next to me\nShe's crashing on your skin\nSettling in, burning so deep, deep\nOn your skin, skin while you sleep, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nI can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest\nI can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips\nMaybe I should be more like her\nMaybe I should be more like her\nI can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too\nAnd she's perfect", "image": "https://images.genius.com/40f96db9aed57c3cc719b7d22638a7a2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Selena Gomez"}
