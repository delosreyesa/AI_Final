Shake it up!\nDJ set it off\nTake it up a notch\nAll together now\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nBreak it down, break it down\nI've got something to say\nWhen you're dancing with me\nIt's like we go M-I-A\nMake a scene, make a scene\nNobody can ignore\nDon't knock it, till you rock it\nWe can't take it no more\nBring the lights up\nBust the doors down\nDust your self off\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nDJ set it off\nTake it up a notch\nAll together now\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nSh-sh-sh-Shake it up\nYou gotta change it up\nAnd if the days not right\nJust brush it off tonight\nPut on your attitude\nYour in my pocket, move\nAnd when you've had enough\nSh-sh-sh-shake it up!\nBring the lights up\nBust the doors down\nDust yourself off\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nDJ set it off\nTake it up a notch\nAll together now\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nBring the lights up\nBust the doors down\nDust yourself off\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nDJ set it off\nTake it up a notch\nAll together now\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nBring the lights up\nBust the doors down\nDust yourself off\nShake it up!
