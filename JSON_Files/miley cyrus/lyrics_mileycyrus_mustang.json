I'm gone\n\nLike where was he raised?\nWhat kind of game he plays?\nWell, none would be my choice\nI ask him 'bout his swagger\nHe didn't knew what that was\nHe said it sounds like swagger is for boys\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy daddy likes you\nYou make me feel alive\nMy daddy likes you\nI'd never say goodbye\nMy daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\n\nSo why did you throw a fit?\nMy daddy likes you\nYou cursed a little bit\nMy daddy likes you\nI still put up with your shit\nBut my daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou drive a classic Mustang\nThe ones with the stock wheels you didn't change\nPlus it has a new system that bangs\nIt makes me say \u201cdaaang\u201d\nWill you take me for a spin?\nIn your classic Mustang\nMake your driveway look like a picture frame\nPlus you got that nice leather with no stains\nSmell like daaang\nWill you take me for a spin?\nBeep beep\n\n[Verse 2]\nHard to imagine it\nWe build up all this passion\nWe found baby is what I am on\nCruising all and crashing\nI can't believe is lasting\nI think it really turns me on\nNothing too dramatic\nThe love is gymnastics i'm fliping\nBaby yeah I'm gone\nDancing 'till the morning\nLightning up and pouring\nAnd trust me you ain't like other boys\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy daddy likes you\nYou make me feel alive\nMy daddy likes you\nI'd never say goodbye\nMy daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\n\nSo why did you throw a fit?\nMy daddy likes you\nYou cursed a little bit\nMy daddy likes you\nI still put up with your shit\nBut my daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\nMy daddy likes you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou drive a classic Mustang\nThe ones with the stock wheels you didn't change\nPlus it has a new system that bangs\nIt makes me say \u201cdaaang\u201d\nWill you take me for a spin?\nIn your classic Mustang\nMake your driveway look like a picture frame\nPlus you got that nice leather with no stains\nSmell like daaang\nWill you take me for a spin?\nBeep beep", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09bd7dd09805e2198fbae25f55f58166.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
