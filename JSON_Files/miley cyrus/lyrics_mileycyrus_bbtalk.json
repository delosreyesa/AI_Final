That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me\nI mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth\nLike, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do\nAnd remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...\nWell, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world\nYou know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck\nI'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit\nI mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo\n\n[Chorus 3]\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking\nLove me so you stop baby talking\nI don't really wanna let go of you\nI heard I change my mind way too often\nYour baby talk is creeping me out\nFuck me so you'll stop baby talking", "image": "https://images.genius.com/40ad323f976f232c54a2484d301cd7e1.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
