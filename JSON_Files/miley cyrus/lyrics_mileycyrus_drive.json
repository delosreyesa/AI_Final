Yeah\nBut I guess I got no valentine\nSend me roses, I'll just let 'em die\nI was crazy thinking you were mine\nIt was all just a lie\n\n[Chorus]\nDrive my heart into the night\nYou could drop the keys off in the morning\n'Cause I don't wanna leave home (Leave home) without your love\nWithout it\n\n[Bridge]\nI always knew I never wanted this\nI never thought it could happen (Never thought it could happen)\nYou acted like you wanted this\nBut then you led me on (Led me on)\nI thought you would be there when I go (When I go)\nYou promised you would be there when I go (I go)\nBut all broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished\nAll I know are the facts\nThat when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies\nBeen there, done that\n\n[Chorus]\nDrive my heart into the night (Yeah, yeah)\nYou could drop the keys off in the morning\n'Cause I don't wanna leave home without your love\nWithout it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/baecc6f9cba44e3e9030d2403584e6c6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
