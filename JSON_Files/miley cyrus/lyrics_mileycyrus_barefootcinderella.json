Don't need no slippers or a party dress\nThe way you're looking right now's what I like the best.\"\nAnd then you'll say, \"Do you want to take a chance\nAnd stay with me forever?\nNo one will ever be more beautiful\nMy barefoot, barefoot Cinderella.\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nA dream world is always perfect, but that\u2019s not my real life\nWish you did, but you don't know the me I am inside\nI pray that you'll come looking, and I won't hide\nI'll be smiling when you find me\n'Cause I've been waiting\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you ask, \"Do you want to dance, my Barefoot Cinderella? Don't need no slippers or a party dress\nThe way you're looking right now's what I like the best.\"\nAnd then you'll say, \"Do you want to take a chance\nAnd stay with me forever?\nNo one will ever be more beautiful\nMy barefoot, barefoot Cinderella.\"\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen I close my eyes it starts, yeah\nLike a movie for my heart\nHere comes my favorite part\nYeah, yeah, oh\n\n[Breakdown]\nWhen you ask, \"Do you want to dance, my Barefoot Cinderella? Don't need no slippers or a party dress\nThe way you're looking right now's what I like the best.\"\nAnd then you'll say, \"Do you want to take a chance\nAnd stay with me forever?\nNo one will ever be more beautiful.\"\nCinderella\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you ask, \"Do you want to dance, my Barefoot Cinderella?
