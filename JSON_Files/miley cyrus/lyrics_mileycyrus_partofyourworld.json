I got twenty\nBut who cares?\nNo big deal\nI want more\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI wanna be where the people are\nI wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'\nWalkin' around on those\nWhat to ya call 'em?\nOh, feet!\nFlippin' your fins, you don't get too far\nLegs are required for jumpin', dancin'\nStrollin' along down a\nWhat's that word again?\nStreet\nUp where they walk, up where they run\nUp where they stay all day in the sun\nWanderin' free\nWish I could be part of that world\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat would I give if I could live outta these waters?\nWhat would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?\nBetcha on land, they understand\nBet they don't reprimand their daughters\nProper women, sick of swimmin', ready to stand\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd ready to know what the people know\nAsk 'em my questions and get some answers\nWhat's a fire and why does it\nWhat's the word?\nBurn\nWhen's it my turn?\nWouldn't I love, love to explore that shore above?\nOut of the sea\nWish I could be part of that world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3e2c9408248df046616bdf8c2ecc0bc9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
