Please let me know\nWhere's the finish line?\n'Cause I've got to find somewhere to go\nI don't wanna hear, people interfere\nWhat do they know?\nWhat I feel inside when I'm up all night\nNeeding you home\nI don't know why\n\n[Chorus]\nTried to run\nBut I keep on coming back full circle\nAnd I can't jump the track\nCan't let you go, oh, oh, oh\nTied to one\nSo I keep on coming back full circle\n'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around\n'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around\n\n[Bridge]\nI'll keep on running 'til we meet in the middle\nI'll put pride aside, and I'll give just a little\nThere's miles to go, but we both know that we'll make it\nAnd I know why\n\n[Chorus]\nTried to run\nBut I keep on coming back full circle\nAnd I can't jump the track\nCan't let you go, oh\nTied to one\nSo I keep on coming back full circle\n'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, I know you'll come around\nYou'll come around\nYeah, I know you'll come around\nYou'll come around", "image": "https://images.genius.com/225c2b820d9d092b11cd1997af027970.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
