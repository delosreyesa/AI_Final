(Your fear is holding you back)\nKiss it goodbye! (Your little panic attack)\nKiss it goodbye! (I, I did it, and it's OMG)\nI'm a different girl\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou procrastinate the world, it's gonna pass you by\nAlready running late, instead of running, better fly\nYou crashed into the ground, and hard\nYou pick yourself and laugh\nYou keep on shooting for the stars\nWhat other choice do you have?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBlow another chance?\nNo, I'll understand\nYo, if you're coming, hello\n\n[Chorus]\nKiss it goodbye! (Your fear is holding you back)\nKiss it goodbye! (Your little panic attack)\nKiss it goodbye! (I, I did it, and it's OMG)\nI'm a different girl\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\n\n[Bridge]\nKiss, kiss, kiss it all goodbye-bye\nKiss, kiss, kiss it all goodbye-bye\nKiss, kiss, kiss it all goodbye-bye\nKiss, kiss, kiss it all goodbye\n\n[Interlude]\nKiss\nYeah, yeah\nKiss it all goodbye\nYeah\n\n[Chorus]\nKiss it goodbye! (Your fear is holding you back)\nKiss it goodbye! (Your little panic attack)\nKiss it goodbye! (I, I did it, and it's OMG)\nI'm a different girl\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye\nKiss it goodbye-ye-ye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b01a985afc1c9318f568a6a06bae6924.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
