Um\nWhatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse/bear thing I've ever seen\nI'm a unicorn if you can't tell\nYou're the cutest unicorn in the world\nThat's fine, we can just go to riff on it\nSorry I was fucking up, I was drifting sorry\nI was flirting sorry, sorry I was flirting, sorry\nAlright everybody, sorry I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here\n\n[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]\nNow I'm walking again to the beat of a drum\nAnd I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart\nOnly shadows ahead barely clearing the roof\nGet to know the feeling of liberation and relief\n\n[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]\nHey now, hey now, don't dream it's over\nHey now, hey now, when the world comes in\nThey come, they come to build a wall between us\nAnd we know they won't win\nHey now, hey now, don't dream\nHey now, hey now, world, you're an angel Ariana Grande\nHey now, hey now\nHey now, hey now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15de3ff237c2424e6251d6a7e47d5c7e.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
