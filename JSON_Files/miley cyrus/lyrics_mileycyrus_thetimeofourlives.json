Let\u2019s just give this a try\nAlright\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's have the time of our lives\nLike there's no one else around\nJust throw your hands up high\nEven when they try to take us down\nWe'll have the time of our lives\n'Til the lights burn out\nLet's laugh until we cry\nLife is only what you make it now\nLet's have the time of our lives\n\n[Bridge]\nLooking back, what are we waiting for?\nTake that chance, now's all we got for sure\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's have the time of our lives\nLike there's no one else around\nJust throw your hands up high\nEven when they try to take us down\nWe'll have the time of our lives\n'Til the lights burn out\nLet's laugh until we cry\nLife is only what you make it now\nLet's have the time of our lives", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4cee903f6ba3023efcfa9b69e6d6db72.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
