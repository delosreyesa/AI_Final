Yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feel the thirst pouring out of me\nThe things that I wanna try\nThat echoes in my head\nThis is the first time I get to see\nThings I've never seen in my life, yeah\nYou make flowers grow under my bed, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou're sexy, sexy\nI got things I wanna do to you\nMake me, make me\nMake my tongue just go do-do-do\nFlex it, flex it\nFlex your muscles, and go through the roof\nArrest it -rest it, 'cause you're a criminal\n\n[Chorus]\nI been laying in this bed (This bed) all night long (All night long)\nDon't you think it's time? (It's time to get it on, yeah)\nBut we gotta get it right (Get it right)\nWe can't get it wrong (Can't get it wrong)\nDon't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah\n\n[Spoken Interlude]\nDo you feel me?\nOh! I thought so\nI just uh... sometime you just wanna... be naughty!\n\n[Bridge]\nFeel so alone when you are gone\nFeeling right back home when I'm in your arms\nYou played my strings, like my guitar\nWhen I look in your eyes, I see all the stars\n\n[Verse 3]\nWould you believe\nI'm dancing in the mirror? (Dancing in the mirror)\nI feel like I got no panties on\nI wish that I could feel ya (Wish that I could feel ya)\nSo hurry, hang up that damn phone\n\n[Chorus]\nI been laying in this bed (This bed) all night long (All night long)\nDon't you think it's time? (It's time to get it on)\nBut we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong\nDon't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nGoing on and on and make it last forever\nWhat you want all day?\nJust as long as it's you and I together\nBabe, don't make me wait, yeah\nOoh, oh\nDon't make me wait\nYeah, yeah, yeah, uh\nBaby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/baecc6f9cba44e3e9030d2403584e6c6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Miley Cyrus"}
