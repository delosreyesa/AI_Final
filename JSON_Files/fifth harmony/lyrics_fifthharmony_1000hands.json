Cause you know I'll do the same\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Dinah]\nWarm me with your touch, pressure from your fingertips\nNever be enough, I'll do nothing but submit\n\n[Chorus: Camila]\nI just wanna feel a thousand hands from you and only you\nCan you make me feel a thousand hands from you and only you?\n\n[Outro: Camila]\nI just want to feel a thousand, from you\nA thousand hands from you\nJust wanna feel a thousand\nA thousand hands from you\nFeel a thousand hands from you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cca7db660ca2ff5690d9116c8ffeb2d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Fifth Harmony"}
