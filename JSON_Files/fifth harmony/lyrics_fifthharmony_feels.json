(steal it from you)\nOh, to memorize the way you shock me (ou, ou)\nThe way you move it here\nJust wanna feel it from you (feel it from you)\n\nDon't be afraid to catch feels (feel, feels, ha ha)\nOh, ride drop top and chase thrills\nI know (I know), I know you ain't afraid to pop pills\nOh baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels\nFeels with me\n\nI'm your window shopper, shopper\nSucker for your love, oh\nAnd I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality (hey)\nIt ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar\nAs long as it shocks you, memory, electricity\n\nWow, that felt great\nThat one felt awesome\nCan you hear the back, yeaa can we hear that back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af750de09aa71291f1b17dfc5ccd239e.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Fifth Harmony"}
