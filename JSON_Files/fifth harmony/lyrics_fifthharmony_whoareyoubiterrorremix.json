Am I crazy?\nAm I losing hold of your love baby?\nEither you want me or you don't\nI need to know, I need to know\n\n[Chorus: Dinah & (Ally)]\nWho are you today?\nWill you be the sun or the pouring rain?\nWho are you tomorrow?\nWill you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?\nWho are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?\nWho are you gonna be when there's nobody there?\nWho are you today?\n'Cause I am still (still) the same\n\n[Interlude: Camila]\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Verse 2: Normani & Lauren & Ally]\nMonday, you had my heart\nTuesday, you had me screaming\nWednesday, we didn't part\nThursday, you didn't mean it\nFriday, I shook it off\nSaturday, you got it wrong\nSunday, I said I needed space\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ally & Camila]\nDo you miss me? Am I crazy?\nAm I losing hold of your love baby?\nEither you want me or you don't\nI need to know, I need to know\n\n[Chorus: Dinah & Dinah and Camila]\nWho are you today?\nWill you be the sun or the pouring rain?\nWho are you tomorrow?\nWill you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?\nWho are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?\nWho are you gonna be when there's nobody there?\nWho are you today?\n'Cause I am still the same\n\n[Interlude: Camila]\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Break: All]\nWho are you? Who are you?\n\n[Bridge: Dinah and Normani & Lauren and Camila & Ally]\nIt's so strange how the same thing\nCan make you feel so right\nAnd bring you so much pain\nIt's so strange how the same face\nCan make you love until it hurts\nWhere do we go? (Where do we go?)\nI need to know (I need to know)\n\n[Chorus: Dinah & Ally & Dinah and Ally]\nWho are you today? (Today)\nWill you be the sun or the pouring rain? (Or the pouring rain)\nWho are you (Who are you?) tomorrow?\nWill you make me smile or just bring me sorrow?\nWho are you gonna be when I'm lost and I'm scared?\nWho are you gonna be when there's nobody there?\nWho are you (Who are you?) today? (Today)\n'Cause I am still (still) the same, yeah\nThe same\n\n[End: Camila]\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d7c737015e837bc1723c81f58c391313.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Fifth Harmony"}
