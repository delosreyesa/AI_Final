How can I love when I'm afraid to fall\nBut watching you stand alone?\nAll of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow, one step\nCloser\n\n[Chorus: Ally, Camila and Lauren & Normani and Dinah & All]\nI have died everyday waiting for you\n(Waiting for you)\nDarling, don't be afraid, I have loved you\n(I have loved you)\nFor a thousand years\nI'll love you for a thousand more\n\n[Verse 2: Lauren & All]\nTime stands still, beauty in all she is\nEvery breath, every hour has come to this, one step\nCloser\n\n[Chorus: All & (Ally) & (Dinah)]\nI have died every day waiting for you (waiting for you)\nDarling, don't be afraid, I have loved you (I have loved you)\nFor a thousand years\nI'll love you for a thousand more\nAnd all along I believed I would find you\n(I would find you)\nTime has brought your heart to me\n(No, no, no no, oh)\nI have loved you for a thousand years\nI'll love you for a thousand more", "image": "https://images.genius.com/728a6e4267132bb73a8e8ce36ec52626.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Fifth Harmony"}
