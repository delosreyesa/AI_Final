You can't tell somebody how - wha-what's happening, what's going on in your- I can't.\"\n- \"Why don't you just try?\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nLet those fools be loud\nLet alarms ring out\n'Cause you cut through all the noise\nLet the days be dark\nLet me hate my work\n'Cause you cut through all the noise\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBring me some hope\nBy wandering into my mind\nSomething to hold onto\nMorning, noon day, or night\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light that is blinding me\nYou're the anchor that I tied to my brain\n'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea\nYou're the song I sing again and again\nAll the time, all the time\nI think of you all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet the parties end when we lose our friends\n'Cause you cut through all the noise\nLet the years roll on 'till the static comes\n'Cause you cut through all the noise\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBring me some hope\nBy wandering into my mind\nSomething to hold onto\nMorning, noon day, or night\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light that is blinding me\nYou're the anchor that I tied to my brain\n'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea\nYou're the song I sing again and again\nAll the time, all the time\nI think of you all the time\nAll the time, all the time\nI think of you all the time\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBring me some hope\nBy wandering into my mind\nSomething to hold onto\nMorning, noon day, or night\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the light that is blinding me\nYou're the anchor that I tied to my brain\n'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea\nYou're the song I sing again and again\nAll the time, all the time\nI think of you all the time\nAll the time, all the time\nI think of you all the time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f179dc72d3fe95cc06d24adca0e41acc.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
