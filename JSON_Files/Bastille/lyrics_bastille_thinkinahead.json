'A storm that will swallow the children. And I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain. I'll deliver the children back to their doorsteps. I'll send the monsters back to the underground. I'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them except for me'...\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nA tornado flew around my room before you came\nExcuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain\nIn Southern California, much like Arizona\nMy eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when...\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)\nI've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)\nI've been thinking 'bout you\nDo you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?\n\n[Chorus]\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it\nGot a beach house I could sell you in Idaho, since you think\nI don't love you I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you\nGot a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)\nI've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)\nI've been thinking 'bout you\nDo you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?\n\n[Chorus]\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh\n\n[Bridge]\nYes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?\nYou know you were my first time, a new feel\nIt will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive\nWe'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh\n\n[Excerpt 2]\n[Lady 1]: We're all so proud of you\n[Lady 2]: Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud\n[Lady 3]: What are you going to do now?\n[Ben]: I was going to go upstairs for a minute\n[Lady 3]: No, I meant with your future\n[Lady 2]: Your life\n[Ben]: Well, that's a little hard to say\n[Mr. McQuire]: Ben!\n[Ben]: (to the ladies) Excuse me.
