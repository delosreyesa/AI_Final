Can you fill it?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve\nAnd I have always buried them deep beneath the ground\nDig them up, let's finish what we've started\nDig them up, so nothing's left unturned\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAre counted\n\n[Chorus]\nYou have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve\nAnd I have always buried them deep beneath the ground\nDig them up, let's finish what we've started\nDig them up, so nothing's left unturned\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAre counted\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws and all of your flaws\nAnd all of your flaws are counted", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8de21e5155b479254475260ab7eae486.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
