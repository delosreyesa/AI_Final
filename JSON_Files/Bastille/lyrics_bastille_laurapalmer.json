Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\n[Verse 2]\nSummer evening breezes blew, drawing voices deep from you\nLead by your beating heart\nWhat a year and what a night, what terrifying final sights\nPut out your beating heart\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe night was all you had\nYou ran into the night from all you had\nFound yourself a path up on the ground\nYou ran into the night; you can't be found\n\n[Chorus 1]\nBut, this is your heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you had your gun\nWould you shoot it at the sky?\nWhy--to see where it would fall\nOr will you come down at all?\n\nIf you had your gun\nWould you shoot it at the sky?\nWhy--to see where your bullet would fall\nOr will you come down at all?\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThis is your heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThis is your racing heart\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\nPumps through your veins\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/e3e6b505b4c6fd595601cf8c43c6eea4.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
