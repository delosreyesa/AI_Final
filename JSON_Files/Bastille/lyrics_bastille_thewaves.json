We sink or swim\n(We're riding the wave)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, what would your mother say if she could see what we're doing now?\nOh, what would your mother say if she could hear what we talk about? (Hey)\n\n[Chorus]\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me\nI'll see you on the other side\nGet carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught up in, caught up in the waves\n\n[Bridge]\nThe air hit me on the way out\nDid it make me more sober or make me more drunk?\nI couldn't quite remember the vision of you and of me\nThe air hit me on the way out\nDid it make me more sober or make me more drunk?\nI couldn't quite remember the vision of you and of me\n\n[Chorus]\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me again, again, again\nThe waves are crashing down on you and me\nI'll see you on the other side\nGet carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught up in, caught up in the waves\n\n[Outro]\nThey're crashing down, they're crashing down, oh\n(The waves)\nThey're crashing down on you and me\nI'll see you on the other side\n(We're riding the wave)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ff636cddca02660bb419b15df092ee8.543x543x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
