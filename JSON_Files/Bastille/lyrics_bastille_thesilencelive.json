What you good for?\nIf you give it a name, then it's already won\nWhat you good for? What you good for?\nIf you give it a name, then it's already won\nWhat you good for? What you good for?\nIf you give it a name, then it's already won\nWhat you good for? What you good for?\n\n[Chorus]\nIt is not enough to be dumbstruck\nCan you fill this silence?\nYou must have the words\nIn that head of yours\nAnd, oh, oh, can you feel this silence\nI can't take it anymore\n'Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7812a3617499f949226a2d5797d9699f.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
