Lost and found each other\nSo don't, don't leave me alone\nDon't leave me alone, don't leave me alone\nWhy would we divide when we could come together?\n\n[Outro]\nRoll the window down, won't let you go like this\nGo like this, go like this\nRoll the window down, won't let you go like this\nGo like this, go like this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ff636cddca02660bb419b15df092ee8.543x543x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
