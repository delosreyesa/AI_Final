So cynical\n\n[Chorus]\nSo you're a tough guy\nLike it really rough guy\nJust can't get enough guy\nChest always so puffed guy\nI'm that bad type\nMake your mama sad type\nMake your girlfriend mad tight\nMight seduce your dad type\nI'm the bad guy\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Bad decisions that we made)\nI'm the bad guy\n(Bad decisions that we made)\n\n[Bridge]\nI want your love, and your lover's revenge\nYou and me could write a bad romance\nI want your love, and I want your revenge\nYou and me could write a bad romance\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught in a bad romance\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught in a bad romance\nI'm a bad guy\nI'm the bad guy\n\n[Verse 2]\nI like it when you take control\nEven if you know that you don't\nOwn me, I'll let you play the role\nI'll be your animal\nMy mommy likes to sing along with me\nBut she won't sing this song\nIf she reads all the lyrics\nShe'll pity the men I know\n\n[Chorus]\nSo you're a tough guy\nLike it really rough guy\nJust can't get enough guy\nChest always so puffed guy\nI'm that bad type\nMake your mama sad type\nMake your girlfriend mad tight\nMight seduce your dad type\nI'm the bad guy\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Bad decisions that we made)\nI'm the bad guy\n(Bad decisions that we made)\nI'm the bad guy\n(Bad decisions that we made)\nI'm the bad guy\n(Bad decisions that we made)\n\n[Bridge]\nI want your love, and your lover's revenge\nYou and me could write a bad romance\nI want your love, and I want your revenge\nYou and me could write a bad romance\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught in a bad romance\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nCaught in a bad romance\nI'm a bad guy\nI'm the bad guy\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood\n'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou know it used to be mad love\nSo take a look what you've done\n'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood\nYou're the bad guy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9a7c28872d0ccc96a30fce5895967e9b.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
