And were they ringing true?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd all their words for glory\nWell they always sounded empty\nWhen we're looking up for heaven\nLooking up for heaven\nAnd way down here upon the ground\nWhen we're lying in the dirt\nThere's no looking up for heaven\nLooking up for heaven\n\n[Bridge]\nI'll take my chances on the curb here with you\nWe watched the planes leave us behind\nOn the curb here with you\nWe watched the planes leave us behind\n\nAnd then you put your hand in mine\nAnd pulled me back from things divine\nStop looking up for heaven\nWaiting to be buried\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd all their words for glory\nWell they always sounded empty\nWhen we're looking up for heaven\nLooking up for heaven\nWay down here upon the ground\nWhen we're lying in the dirt\nThere's no looking up for heaven\nLooking up...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/48ac8c2ad335e42f97d49a73430de3f8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
