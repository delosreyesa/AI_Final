Can you fill it?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve\nAnd I have always buried them deep beneath the ground\nDig them up\nLet's finish what we've started\nDig them up\nSo nothing's left unturned\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll of your flaws and all of my flaws\nWhen they have been exhumed\nWe'll see that we need them to be who we are\nWithout them, we'd be doomed\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere's a hole in my soul\nI can't fill it, I can't fill it\nThere's a hole in my soul\nCan you fill it?
