The stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night of your dear Savior's birth\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\n'Til He appeared and the Soul felt its worth\n\nThe thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn\nFall on your knees; O hear the angel voices!\nO night divine! O night that leads to morn\n\nFall on your knees; O hear the angel voices!\nO night divine! O night when Christ was born\nO night! O holy night!\nO night divine!\n\n[Outro]\nHold me in your arms, hold me in your arms\nI'll be buried here with you\nAnd I'll hold in these hands\nAll that remains", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a9e2f6df6b650d76991df9610356b30e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bastille"}
