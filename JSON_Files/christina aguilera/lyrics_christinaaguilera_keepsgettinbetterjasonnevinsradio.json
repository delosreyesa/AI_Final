I don't care what you say\n'Cause when we're both in the ring\nYou're gonna like it my way\nYeah, baby, there's a villain in me\nSo sexy, sour and sweet\nAnd you'll be lovin' it, ah\n\n[Chorus]\nSome days I'm a super... (super...)\nUp to my old tricks\nBut it won't last forever (it won't last forever, no)\nNext day, I'm your super girl (super girl)\nOut to save the world\nAnd it keeps gettin' better\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nHold on - it keeps gettin' better\nHold on - it keeps gettin' better\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the blink of an eye\nIn the speed of the light\nI hold the universe up\nWhile making planets collide\nWhen I strap on my boots\nAnd I slip on my suit\nYou see, the vixen in me\nBecomes an angel for you\n\n[Chorus]\nSome days I'm a super... (super..)\nUp to my old tricks\nBut it won't last forever (it won't last forever, no)\nNext day, I'm your super girl (super girl)\nOut to save the world\nAnd it keeps gettin' better\nSome days I'm a super... (a super...)\nUp to my old tricks\nBut it won't last forever (no, no)\nNext day, I'm your super girl (super girl)\nOut to save the world\nAnd it keeps gettin' better\n\n[Outro]\nHold on - it keeps gettin' better\nHold on - it keeps gettin' better", "image": "https://images.genius.com/779638e8369dbf1c8c8184cf3cac21ab.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
