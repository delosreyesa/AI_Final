Can't resist it\nThis has caught me by surprise\nShould I let him take me to Puerto Rico?\nI can't hold back no more\nLet's go tonight\n(Woo, hey)\n\n[Interlude]\nPapi, hold me\nSay that you adore me (You adore me)\nNever let go\nNever leave me lonely (eave me lonely)\nPapi, hold me\nSay that you adore me (Oh)\nNever let go\nNever leave me lonely\n\n[Chorus]\nI am full blood boricua (Boricua)\nReads the tattoo on his arm (On his arm)\nHe tells me, \"Mami, I need ya\"\nAnd my heartbeat pumps so strong (So strong)\nGetting lost in el ritmo\nHe whispers, \"Te quiero, te quiero\" (Oh)\nI begin to give in with no hesitation\nCan't help my infatuation\n(I can't help what I'm feelin', I'm infatuated)\nIt's pure infatuation (Oh)\nCan't help my infatuation (Oh, whoa, oh)\nIt's pure infatuation\nHey", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e9b79bcc97e4079c3ba83d34d57daa2.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
