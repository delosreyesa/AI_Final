(say)\nI think that we're on our way\n\n[Verse 2]\nTogether, we'll weather\nMany storms as family\nThat bond is forever\nBigger than most anything\nThe love I feel for you grows everyday, ay\nThe more we get to learn from our mistakes, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI think we're on our way\nThrough all the lows and highs\nNeed you by my side, singin'\nI think we're on our way\nTo better days, better days, oh\nLet's say we turn the page\nMove on from all the times\nShould've laughed, not cried, feelin'\nWhat is there more to say?
