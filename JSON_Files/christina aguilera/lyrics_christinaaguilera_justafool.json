I had my heart set on you\nBut nothin' else hurts like you do\nWho knew that love was so cruel (yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd I... waited and waited so long\nFor someone who'll never come home\nIt's my fault to think you'd be true (yeah, yeah)\nI'm just a fool\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]\nI say that I don't care and walk away, whatever\nAnd I tell myself we were bad together (uh-huh)\nBut that's just me tryin' to move on without you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Christina Aguilera & Blake Shelton]\nBut who am I kidding?\nI know what I'm missing\n\n[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & Both]\nI...
