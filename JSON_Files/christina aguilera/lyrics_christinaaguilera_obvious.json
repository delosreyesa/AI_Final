They tremble\nWonder why I can't look you in the eyes\nDon't know how long\nI can keep this inside\nIsn't it obvious?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I don't know what I'm doing anymore\nI'm feeling like a little girl\nCaught up in emotions\nI'm out of control\nIsn't it obvious?\n\n[Verse 3]\nSuddenly these emotions are in control of my heart\nCan you see it in my eyes?\nEvery glance, every smile\nMust give me away\nAnd I feel so much I can't hide\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't know what I'm doing anymore\nI'm feeling like a little girl, a little girl\nCaught up in emotions\nI'm out of control\nIsn't it obvious?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e64fe0c629d733b337ddda28346a9a48.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
