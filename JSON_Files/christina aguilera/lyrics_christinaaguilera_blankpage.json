How do I say I'm sorry?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was scared, I was unprepared\nOh, for the things you said\nIf I could undo that I hurt you\nI would do anything for us to make it through\n\n[Chorus]\nDraw me a smile and save me tonight\nI am a blank page, waiting for you to bring me to life\nPaint me a heart, let me be your art\nI am a blank page, waiting for life to start\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLet our hearts stop and beat as one together\nLet out hearts stop and beat as one forever\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow can I erase decisions I've made?\nHow do I go back? What more can I say?\nAll that remains are hearts filled with shame\nHow do we say we're sorry? How do we say we're sorry?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I was scared, I was unprepared\nOh, for the things you said\nIf I could undo that I hurt you\nI would do anything for us to make it through\n\n[Chorus]\nDraw me a smile and save me tonight\nI am a blank page, waiting for you to bring me to life\nPaint me a heart, let me be your art\nI am a blank page, waiting for life to start\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLet our hearts stop and beat as one together\nLet out hearts stop and beat as one forever\n\n[Bridge]\nI go back in time and I realize\nOur spirits alive and we never died\n\n[Chorus]\nDraw me a smile and save me tonight\nI'll be your blank page, waiting for you to bring me to life\nPaint me a heart, let me be your art\nI am a blank page, waiting for life to start\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLet our hearts stop and beat as one together\nLet out hearts stop and beat as one forever", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e6ebd25e4553d64efb95683d92416319.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
