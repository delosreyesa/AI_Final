Shout louder\nLettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down\n\n[Post-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]\nNobody can hold us down (Hold us down)\nNobody can hold us down (Hold us down)\nNobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)\nNever can, never will\n\n[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]\nSo, what am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?\nAre you offended with the message I'm bringin'?\nCall me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing\nGuess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing\nIf you look back in history\nIt's a common double standard of society\nThe guy gets all the glory, the more he can score\nWhile the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore\nI don't understand why it's OK\nThe guy can get away with it, the girl gets named\nAll my ladies come together and make a change\nAnd start a new beginning for us, everybody sing\n\n[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & (Lil' Kim)]\nThis is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)\nWho've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)\nThinkin' all women should be seen not heard\n(You can't get rid of us)\nSo what do we do girls? Shout louder\nLettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground\n(We standin' our ground on this one)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)\n\n[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]\nHere's something I just can't understand\nIf a guy have three girls then he's the man\nHe can even give her some head, then sex her raw\nIf a girl do the same, then she's a whore\nBut the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it\nCats take my ideas and put they name on it\nIt's aiight though, you can't hold me down\nI got to keep on movin'\nTo all my girls with a man who be tryna mack\nDo it right back to him and let that be that\nYou need to let him know that his game is whack\nAnd Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera gotcha back\n\n[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]\nYou're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy\nYou must talk so big, to make up for smaller things\nSaid you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy\nYou must talk so big, to make up for smaller things\nThis is for my girls\n\n[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]\nThis is for my girls all around the world, oh\nWho've come across a man that don't respect your worth\n(Respect your worth, oh)\nThinkin' all women should be seen not heard\nSo what do we do girls? Shout louder (Shout louder)\nLettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down (Whoa)\nThis is for my girls all around the world (All my girls)\nWho've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Around the world)\nThinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Yeah)\nSo what do we do girls? Shout louder\nLettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)\nLift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)\nTake a deep breath and say it loud\nNever can, never will, can't hold us down\n\n[Breakdown: Christina Aguilera & Lil' Kim]\n(Uh, oh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)\nSpread the word (Can't hold us down)\nYeah, we here, we back again, yeah\nLil' Kim and Christina Aguilera\nYeah (Can't hold us down, uh, uh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9263d9b9af050b938278cc84123ae45d.583x583x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
