century of lonely nights\nWaiting for someone to release me\nYou're lickin' your lips and blowing kisses my way\nBut that don't mean I'm gonna give it away\nBaby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay\nI'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way\nIf you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true\nYou gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do\nIf you wanna be with me, baby, there's a price to pay\nI'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way\nIf you wanna be with me, I can make

baby\nCome, come, come on and let me out\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe music's banging and the lights down low\nJust one more dance and then we're good to go\nWaiting for someone who needs me\nHormones racing at the speed of light\nBut that don't mean it's gotta be tonight\nBaby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh,
