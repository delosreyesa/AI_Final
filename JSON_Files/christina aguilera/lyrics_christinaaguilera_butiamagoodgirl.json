By the way\nAbove Sunset Strip, the Hills all the way\nMy rings are by Webster, they make their heads twirl\nThey all say \u201cDarling, what did you do for those pearls?\u201d\nWhat?! I am a good girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nB.H. I adore, Rodeo L'amore\nBreakfast Polo Lounge, and poolside for sure\nThe Chateau for cocktails, the Courtyard at nine\nDan Tana's for dinner, the Helen's divine\nYou know I have found, the word\u2019s gone around\nThey all say my feet never do touch the ground\nWhat?! I am a good girl\n\nI am a good girl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cf947c3c1fef398078e75bd999704311.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
