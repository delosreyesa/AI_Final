(will you lift me even higher?)\nWhen you see me crashing\nAnd there's nowhere left to fall\nWill you lift me even higher\nTo rise above this all?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you lift me up\nSaid if you lift me up\nIf you lift me up\nJust get me through this night", "image": "https://images.genius.com/958309738faf387025d4bbb391043fbe.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
