I don't need to know where you've been\nAll I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'\nHey boy! So don't even tell me your name\nAll I need to know is whose place\nAnd let's get walkin'\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanna do is love your body\nTonight's your lucky night, I know you want it\nAll I wanna do is love your body\nTonight's your lucky night, I know you want it\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed\nSo come on and give me your worst (Uh-oh, yeah)\nWe're moving faster than slow\nIf you don't know where to go\nI'll finish off on my own (Oh-oh, yeah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHey boy! I don't need to know where you've been\nAll I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'\nHey boy! So don't even tell me your name\nAll I need to know is whose place\nAnd let's get walkin'\nSay, say, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanna do is love your body\nTonight's your lucky night, I know you want it\nAll I wanna do is love your body (Your body)\nTonight's your lucky night, I know you want it\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nI think you already know my name\nI think you already know my name\nHey, hey, ha! Alright, say\nI think you already know my name\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanna do is love your body (Hey, hey, say)\nTonight's your lucky night, I know you want it\nAll I wanna do is love your body (Say, say, hey)\nTonight's your lucky night, I know you want it", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/fa9a765f77469e81bb9cfac78fc50654.510x510x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
