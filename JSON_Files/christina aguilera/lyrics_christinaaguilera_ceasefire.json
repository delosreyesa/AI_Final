What is our legacy?\nRolling out\nWhite flag, I surrender\nHear me now, make it stop, we can do better\nPain and hurt, living in fear, wasted energy\nIn the end, what is it worth? What is our legacy?\nFollow me now, I'm calling out\nSomebody help me, I need you now\nWhy can't you see? Gotta believe me\nFighting for peace, need a release\nWon't you come with me?\nI'm on your side, swallow your pride\nYou can confide in me, army of one\nRise of the sun, shining for all to see\nEnemy's none, victory's won, no negativity\nWe can be free, we have the key to own our destiny\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, cease fire, fire, fire\nThrow down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons\n(Throw down your weapons)\nI'm on your side, on your side, on your side\nSo please cease fire, fire, fire\nCease fire, make it stop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e6ebd25e4553d64efb95683d92416319.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
