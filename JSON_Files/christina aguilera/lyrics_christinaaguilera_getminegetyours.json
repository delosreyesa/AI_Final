(Ooh, on my waistline)\nWant your skin up against mine\nMove my hips to the baseline\nLet me get mine, you get yours (We don't fall in love)\nHang a 'please don't disturb' sign\nPut my back into a slow grind (Slow grind)\nSending chills up and down my spine\nLet me get mine, you get yours\n\n[Bridge]\nNow listen, so, come on and freak my body\nWe can get nasty, naughty all night, a private party\nGotta hit that spot just right, work me like a nine to five\nIt ain't about the kissin' and huggin'\n'Cause this is a physical lovin'\nStraight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'\nGotta hit that spot just right, work me like a nine to five\n\n[Spoken Bridge]\nWe have a physical thing\nWe make love, but don't fall in love\n(Let me get mine, you get yours)\nWe spend time, just enough so you get yours, and I get mine\nNo strings attached\nI want your body, not your heart\n(Let me get mine, you get yours)\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you put your hands on my waistline? (hands on my waistline)\nWant your skin up against mine\nMove my hips to the baseline\nLet me get mine, you get yours (But don't fall in love)\nHang a 'please don't disturb' sign\nPut my back into a slow grind\nSending chills up and down my spine\nLet me get mine, you get yours\nPut your hands on my waistline (Put your hands on my waistline)\nWant your skin up against mine (Ooh, the waistline)\nMove my hips to the baseline\nLet me get mine, you get yours (Oh, we don't fall in love)\n(Freak my body, baby) Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign\nPut my back into a slow grind (Nasty, naughty, babe)\nSending chills up and down my spine (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nLet me get mine, you get yours (Oo)\n\n[Outro]\nHmm, come here\nDon't be shy, I won't bite\nLet me get mine, you get yours", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e9b79bcc97e4079c3ba83d34d57daa2.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
