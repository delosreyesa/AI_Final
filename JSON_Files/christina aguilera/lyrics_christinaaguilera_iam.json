Make me feel safe from harm\n\n[Chorus]\nJust take me, free me, see through to the core of me\nTake me, free me, there will be no more pretending\n\n[Outro]\nI am temperamental and\nI have imperfections and\nI am emotional\nThere'll be no more pretending\nMmhmm", "image": "https://images.genius.com/958309738faf387025d4bbb391043fbe.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Christina Aguilera"}
