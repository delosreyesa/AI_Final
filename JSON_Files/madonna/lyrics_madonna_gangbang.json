I said drive, bitch!\nAnd while you're at it, die, bitch!\nThat's right, drive, bitch\nNow drive, bitch! I said drive, bitch!\nAnd while you're at it, die bitch!\nThat's right, drive bitch!\n\n[Outro]\nNow if you're gonna act like a bitch\nThen you're gonna die like a bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4b5e10aba1545f267154f423f6e62b11.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
