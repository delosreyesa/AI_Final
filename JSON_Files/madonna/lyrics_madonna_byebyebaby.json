What turns you on?\nWhat makes you feel good?\nDoes it make you feel good to see me cry?\nI think it does\nThat's why it's time to say goodbye\nBye bye\n\n[Outro]\nThe first time and the last time\nYou can forget about it baby\nForget the rules, forget the fools\nForget your fears, forget my tears\nYou can forget about it baby, bye bye baby bye bye\nYou can forget about it baby\n'Cause it's the first time and the last time\nYou'll ever see me cry\nYou fucked it up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e75a3fbd7e9a1d71d8b480906d15e41f.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
