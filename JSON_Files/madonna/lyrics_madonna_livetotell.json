Will I grow old?\nHow will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?\n\n[Chorus]\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\nTill then, it will burn inside of me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nThe truth is never far behind\nYou kept it hidden well\nIf I live to tell the secret I knew\nThen will I ever have the chance again?\n\n[Chorus]\nA man can tell a thousand lies\nI've learned my lesson well\nHope I live to tell the secret I have learned\nTill then, it will burn inside of me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5df146bef5a2d176fa0be60a80fb4fe0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
