(I'm addicted to your love!)\nI'm addicted to your love!\nI'm addicted, I'm addicted\nI'm addicted to your...\n...I'm addicted, I'm addicted\nI'm addicted to your love!\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow that your name pumps like a blood in my veins\nIt pulses through my body, igniting my mind\nAnd it's like MDMA, and that's okay\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour name\u2019s like a drug\nAnd I can't get enough\nAnd it fits like a glove\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm addicted to your love!\nI'm addicted, I'm addicted\nI'm addicted to your...\n...I'm addicted, I'm addicted\nI'm addicted to your love!\n\n[Bridge]\nI need this exchange\nI don't care if you think that I'm strange\nSomething happens to me when I hear your voice\nSomething happens to me and I have no choice\nI need to hear your name\nEverything feels so strange\nI'm willing to take this chance\nI need to dance!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour name\u2019s like a drug\nAnd I can't get enough\nAnd it fits like a glove\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm addicted to your love!\nI'm addicted, I'm addicted\nI'm addicted to your...\n...I'm addicted, I'm addicted\nI'm addicted to your love!\n\n[Outro]\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A\nM-D-N-A, M-D-N-A (I'm addicted)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3cac3828f537e3ec45b968ebdb38eaa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
