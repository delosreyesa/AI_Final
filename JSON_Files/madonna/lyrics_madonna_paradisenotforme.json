S\u00fbrement pas moi\nEncore une fois, je suis cass\u00e9e\nEncore une fois, je ne crois pas\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been so high, I've been so down\nUp to the skies, down to the ground\n\n[Bridge]\nThere is a light above my head\nInto your eyes, my face remains\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been so high, I've been so down\nUp to the skies, down to the ground\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can't remember when I was young\nInto your eyes, my face remains\nInto your eyes, my face remains\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been so high, I've been so down\nUp to the skies, down to the ground\nI've been so high, I've been so down\nUp to the skies, down to the ground", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e42d5014433dc33ec8c0a065d2974f2c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
