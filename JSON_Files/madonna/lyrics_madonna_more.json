More!)\n\nI got rhythm, music too\nJust as much as before\nGot my guy and my sky of blue\nNow, however, I own the view\nMore is better than nothing, true\nBut nothing's better than more, more, more\nNothing's better than more\n\nOne is fun, why not two?\nAnd if you like two, you might as well have four\nAnd if you like four, why not a few?\nWhy not a slew more?\n(More! More!)\n\nIf you've got a little, why not a lot?\nAdd and bit and it'll get to be an oodle\nEvery jot and tittle adds to the pot\nSoon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle\n(More! More!)\n\nNever say when, never stop at plenty\nIf it's gonna rain, let it pour\nHappy with ten, happier with twenty\nIf you like a penny\nWouldn't you like many\nMuch more?\n\nOr does that sound too greedy?\nThat's not greed, no, indeedy\nThat's just stocking the store\nGotta fill your cupboard\nYou remember Mother Hubbard\n(More! More!)\n\nEach possession you possess\nHelps your spirits to soar\nThat's what's soothing about excess\nNever settle for something less\nSomething's better than nothing, yes!\nBut nothing's better than more, more, more\n(Except all, all, all)\nExcept all, all, all\nExcept once you have it all (have it all)\nYou may find all else above (find all else above)\nThat though things are bliss\nThere's one thing you miss, and that's\nMore! More!\nMore! More! More! More!\nMore! More! More!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/94a49d0063d872202e3cfb98147dcc3b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
