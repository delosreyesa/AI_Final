I'm the luckiest girl in the world\nWho wants to marry me?\nThis is very nerve-wrecking\nI mean, I've failed at marriage twice already\nLook, I mean I'm almost shedding a tear right now\nThinking about the third possible failure...\nJust kidding", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c33e64b8dfe2940f27469852245387ca.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Madonna"}
