You a million miles from home\nWhen you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own\nAlways remember that it wasn't that long ago\nI stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you\n\n[Verse 3]\nHeaven waits the hours of silence, finds you on your knees\nBroken in a sweet surrender of peace\nAll the years of searching for a love you didn't know\nNow you've finally found a welcome home\n\n[Chorus]\nDid it come naturally? You a million miles from home\nWhen you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own\nAlways remember that it wasn't that long ago\nI stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you\n\n[Bridge]\nI love you, I have\nAnd I always will\n\n[Chorus]\nDid it come naturally? You a million miles from home\nWhen you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own\nAlways remember that it wasn't that long ago\nI stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say\nDid it come naturally? You a million miles from home\nWhen you tried so carefully to live a life that's not your own\nAlways remember that it wasn't that long ago\nI stilled the oceans, I moved the mountains to say I love you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/324b6da4b956a1d01d3c226f290e4b9f.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
