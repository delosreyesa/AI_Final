(witness)\nWill you be my witness? (witness)\nI'm just looking for a witness in all of this\nLooking for a witness to get me through this\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you tell me everything, there's no holes\nYou can scroll through anything, you've got the codes\nNothing to hide, it's all in their eyes\nAnd we just know, oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, I get myself tonight\nI get myself tonight, oh\nOh, I get myself tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nWe're all just looking for connection\nYeah, we all want to be seen\nI'm looking for someone who speaks my language\nSomeone to ride this ride with me\nCan I get a witness?
