Do you remember?\nDo you remember? Do you remember?\nLa la la la la la\nThere's nothing like the first time\nLa la la la la la\nThere's nothing like the first time\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's not a walk in the park\nIt's not a shot in the dark\nIt's not a juvenile crime\nThere's nothing like the first time\nIt's not like tying the knot\nThere's no connecting the dots\nAnd in case you forgot\nThere's nothing like the first time\nLa la la la la la\nThere's nothing like the first time\nLa la la la la la\nThere's nothing like the first time\nLa la la la la la\nThere's nothing like the first time\n\n[Outro]\nIt's not like reading a map (La la la la la la)\nOh ya, you give me laugh\nThere's nothing like the first time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/69944d31d0582bdd4e3d84b63d09e005.480x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
