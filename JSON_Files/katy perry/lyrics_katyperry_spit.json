I don't know\nSaid something forced me to it, so\nSpit in Your face and passed You by\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut time and time again\nI'd live that life of sin\nI knew it hurt you bad\nBut I wasn't ready to give in\nMaybe someday\nBut not this day I said\nI wanted to live my life\nI was willing to pay the price\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I took up this hammer\nAnd laughed at all Your slander\nAnd pierced Your hands\nWith the nails of blasphemy\nHow could I do this? I don't know\nSaid something forced me to it, so\nSpit in Your face and passed You by\n('Cause I'd forgotten those words\nYour name won't be denied)\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut looking into my eyes\nI knew You felt this heart's cry\nI needed You\nBad my life was oh so sad\nBut looking back at all this pain\nThis guilt, this strife\nWould You take it all away\nIf I were to give you back my life?\n\n[Bridge]\nBut You said\nI've forgiven thee\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe was hanging on a cross\nWith a crown of thorns\nIn His head\nHe was hanging on a cross\nWith a crown of thorns\nIn His head\nHe was hanging on a cross\nWith a crown of thorns\nIn His head\nHe was hanging on a cross\nWith a crown of thorns\nIn His head\n\n[Outro]\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee\nAnd You said\nI've forgiven thee", "image": "https://images.genius.com/324b6da4b956a1d01d3c226f290e4b9f.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
