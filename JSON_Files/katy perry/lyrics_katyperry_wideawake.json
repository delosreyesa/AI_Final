(I'm wide awake)\nAnd now it\u2019s clear to me\nThat everything you see\nAin\u2019t always what it seems (I'm wide awake)\nYeah, I was dreaming for so long\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wish I knew then, what I know now\nWouldn\u2019t dive in, wouldn\u2019t bow down\nGravity hurts, you made it so sweet\n\u2018Til I woke up on, on the concrete\n\n[Chorus]\nFalling from cloud nine\nCrashing from the high\nI'm letting go tonight\nYeah, I'm falling from cloud nine\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm wide awake\nNot losing any sleep\nI picked up every piece\nAnd landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)\nNeed nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)\nYeah, I am born again\nOut of the lion's den\nI don't have to pretend (And it's too late)\nThe story's over now, the end\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI wish I knew then, what I know now\nWouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down\nGravity hurts, you made it so sweet\n'Til I woke up on, on the concrete\n\n[Chorus]\nFalling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)\nCrashing from the high\nI'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)\nI'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)\n\n[Bridge]\nThunder rumbling\nCastles crumbling (I'm wide awake)\nI am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)\nGod knows that I tried\nSeeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)\nBut I'm not blind anymore\n\n[Interlude]\nI'm wide awake\nI'm wide awake\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)\nCrashing from the high\nYou know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)\nI'm falling from cloud nine\n\n[Outro]\nI'm wide awake\nI'm wide awake\nI'm wide awake\nI'm wide awake\nI'm wide awake", "image": "https://images.genius.com/60d037624ec71506ebd10f350c1eb4e5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
