I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you\u2019re the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you\u2019re fine when you\u2019re not really fine, but you just can\u2019t get into it, because they would never understand. Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like \u2018Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this.'\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/da3b4b36e2475eb1804aaaabeaf99658.634x567x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
