Who's walking near?\nOr has my imagination spilled?\nThis little girl all grown up still fears\nOh, and I cry\n\n[Chorus]\nSo hold me close\nFor I'm so tired of holding myself\nSo very tired and tired, tired and tired\nJust hold, hold me close\nFor I'm so tired of holding myself\nSo very tired and tired, tired and tired\nJust hold me\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhere can I go, where can I hide\nFrom these evil sufferings?\nOh, these images painted on my walls\nThey say there's a place that I can\nHide in the shadow of your wings\nOh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge\nNo more tears\n\n[Chorus]\nSo hold me close\nFor I'm so tired of holding myself\nSo very tired and tired, tired and tired\nJust hold, hold me close\nFor I'm so tired of holding myself\nSo very tired and tired, tired and tired, and tired and tired, and tired and tired\nOh, so tired and tired, tired and tired\nJust hold me, hold me close\nFor I'm so tired of holding myself\nSo very tired and tired, tired and tired\nJust hold me, oh, oh\nI am so tired\nOh Lord, I'm so tired\nOh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nHold me\nMe, me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/324b6da4b956a1d01d3c226f290e4b9f.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
