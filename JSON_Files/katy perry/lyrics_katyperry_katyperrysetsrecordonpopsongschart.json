With her latest frame in the lead, Perry passes Mariah Carey, who's totaled 45 weeks at No. 1\n\nHere's an updated look at the acts to spend the most time at No. 1 dating to the Oct. 3, 1992, launch of the Nielsen BDS-based tally, which measures the most weekly plays at mainstream top 40 stations:\n\nWeeks at No. 1, Artist\n46, Katy Perry\n45, Mariah Carey\n32, P!nk\n32, Rihanna\n29, Ace of Base\n26, Maroon 5\n25, Christina Aguilera\n23, Beyonce\n23, Boyz II Men\n23, Nelly\n\nPerry has earned her record-breaking feat courtesy of 11 Pop Songs No. 1s, also a chart best-sum, which she shares with Rihanna. (Notably, the careers of artists like Carey and Boyz II Men pre-date the Pop Songs chart's inception.) Of Perry's 11 leaders, \"Horse\" is the eighth to rule for at least four weeks. She set a personal best when \"California Gurls,\" featuring Snoop Dogg, dominated for seven weeks in 2010\n\nOn its way to granting Perry her latest piece of Pop Songs history, \"Horse\" last week set the mark for the most weekly plays (16,151) in the chart's archives. It passed the 16,065 plays that her prior topper, \"Roar,\" drew on the Oct. 19, 2013, chart\n\nIn addition to its pop airplay success, \"Horse\" topped the all-format airplay/sales/streaming-based Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it's her ninth career No. 1. It's sold 3.5 million downloads, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The song continues to build at multiple radio formats, bulleting at No. 2 on Rhythmic Songs, No. 8 on Adult Pop Songs and No. 28 on Adult Contemporary\n\nAll charts, including Pop Songs, will refresh on Thursday (March 6) on Billboard.com", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd61e4d930e08b8953b98ceb6298f059.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Katy Perry"}
