Would you get my back?\nWould you take my call when I start to crack?\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\nWould you rescue me when I'm by myself?\nWhen I need your love? If I need your help?\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe don't talk much, not anymore\nBroken bottles and slammin' doors\nBut we still care about each other\nSay we care about each other\nI know life took us far away\nBut I still dream 'bout the good old days\nWhen we took care of each other\nWe were livin' for each other\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I start to wonder, wonder\nIf I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nWould you rescue me? Would you get my back?\nWould you take my call when I start to crack?\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\nWould you rescue me when I'm by myself?\nWhen I need your love, if I need your help\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\nWould you rescue me? Would you get my back?\nWould you take my call when I start to crack?\nWould you rescue me? Ah\nWould you rescue me?\nWould you rescue me when I'm by myself?\nWhen I need your love, if I need your help\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I miss all the times we had\nCan't forget what you can't get back\nAnd you can't find it in another\nMan, time, it ain't your lover\nI don't care what you thought before\nI'll be there anytime you call\nDon't you ever call another\nNo need to call another\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I start to wonder, wonder\nIf I'm slipping under, under (Oh, oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nWould you rescue me? Would you get my back?\nWould you take my call when I start to crack?\nWould you rescue me? Ah\nWould you rescue me?\nWould you rescue me when I'm by myself?\nWhen I need your love, if I need your help\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\n\n[Bridge]\nWould you rescue me?\nOh, rescue me\nWould you rescue me?\nOh, rescue me\n\n[Chorus]\nWould you rescue me? Would you get my back?\nWould you take my call when I start to crack?\nWould you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?\nWould you rescue me when I'm by myself?\nWhen I need your love, if I need your help\nWould you rescue me?
