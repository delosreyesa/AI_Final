Do you see my face?\nI want the world to know\nWhat are we now for the love like animals just to find a home\nSearching the horizon for a sign\nAll I see is dark but I sail on\nI can hear my heart beat harder\nI\u2019m still here but not much farther\nNow we sit now we walk\nNow they turn us back down\nI don\u2019t speak I don\u2019t stop\nI just keep on moving\n\n[Chorus: Ryan Tedder + Santigold]\nFly closer to heaven and far from hell\nFly put your wings up so put your wings up\nFly far from the city we know so well\nFly so put your wings up so put your wings up\nTime we say goodbye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/066c5940afd8780621ce01b9301d00bd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "OneRepublic"}
