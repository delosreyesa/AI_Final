Do you think it's too much?\nYou say you only trust what you can touch\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll you got to do is reach out for it\n\n[Chorus]\nAll that you want\nIs standing right in front of you\nAll that you need\nIs love\nAll that you want\nIs standing right in front of you\nAll that you need\nIs love\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalked to the ledge, put out my hands\nScared to the bones of where I'd land\nTrade in my fears, trade in my thoughts\nThey disappear behind your walls\nAll that I want, all that I need\nAll that I thought I believed\nWas it enough? Sure not too much?\nNow you're the only thing that I can trust\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll you got to do is reach out for it\n\n[Chorus]\nAll that you want\nIs standing right in front of you\nAll that you need\nIs love\nAll that you want\nIs standing right in front of you\nAll that you need\nIs love\n\n[Outro]\nIt's all for you\nIt's all for you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2da9e582562262ee00627b4a53673af1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "OneRepublic"}
