You know that mine's the illusion\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd all at once (As I'm trying)\nI can help you out (Just to keep things right)\nI'll be what you need (I kill myself to make)\nI'll do anything (Everything perfect for you)\nGoodbye, apathy\nSo long, apathy\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't sit still, but don't you move away from here\nSo goodbye, apathy (As I'm trying)\nSo long, fancy free (Just to keep things right)\nGoodbye, apathy (I kill myself to make)\nI don't wanna be you (Everything perfect for you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't walk right, not like I used to\nThere's a jump in my step as I rush to see you\nI could be happy here as long as you're near to me\nAs long as you're close to me\nNow that I'm alright (As I'm trying)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI can help you out (Just to keep things right)\nI'll be what you need (I kill myself to make)\nI'll do anything (Everything perfect for you)\nGoodbye, apathy\nSo goodbye, apathy\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't you stop pushing me\nI can take so much\nSo goodbye, apathy (As I'm trying)\nSo long fancy free (Just to keep things right)\nGoodbye, apathy (I kill myself to make)\nI don't wanna be you (Everything perfect for you)\n\n[Outro]\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too\nEverybody is watching you\nEverybody is watching me too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3a90c161f3a591f41879db6009e826b3.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "OneRepublic"}
