{"songs": [{"title": "An Inconvenient Woman", "album": null, "year": "2018-11-11", "lyrics": "Brutally honest, outspoken and fearless\nGoes with their gut, never favors appearance\n'Cause who has time for vanity with opponents to extinguish?\nAnd don't you think that hint of silver hairline is distinguished?\nIn men, all these qualities, they make you a genius\nBut if you're a woman, you're an inconvenience\n\nSo he storms through the halls and he tracks down his boss\nTwo years in this office he's battled across\nA media major, he's craving the glory\nBursts into a meeting, demands better stories\nThe newsroom head is delighted, you must know\n\"Now that's how you do it! Just show me some gusto!\"\nAnd four feet away, in department store heels\nIs his colleague, Sarah\nShe fights back her tears\n'Cause she chased him down every Friday in winter\nThree years in this office, plus two as an intern\nAnd when she requested some tasks with more substance\nHe glanced at his phone and responded, disgusted\n\"Please lower your voice, and how dare you approach me\nReally, your tact could afford you some coaching\nYou're acting so crazy!\" His tone was defeating\n\"And have some respect, I'll be late for my meeting\nYou're being inconvenient\"\n\nIt's 7 PM and her husband's arriving\nShe fires the stove and just stares, though she's trying\nIt's been a few days and she slept on the couch\nDepression has stolen the smile from her mouth\nHe walks in, he's angry, and he asks about dinner\n\"But couldn't we just order in,\" she considers\nHe stares with a vacant and displeased expression\n\"So why do we pay for these therapy sessions?\nIf you can't be decent and take a damn shower\nYou won't ever fuck me, you're crying for hours\nWhen I first ever met you, I loved all your crazy\nYou stayed up all night and you dressed like a lady\nYou fucked like a rabbit, you loved it back then\nBut now you're this lump of a mess in my den\"\nHe stormed out the room and she folded his tie\nShe first bought it for him when his father had died\nHe slept in for days and he missed weeks of work\nSo she took up some supplement shifts as a nurse\nShe never complained, though, she made it a promise\nBut she liked her manic self, too, to be honest\nShe wished that her crazy was sexy and fun, too\nBut depression snuck up and she started to undo\nWhy can't she just man up and act like a wife?\nShe vowed to a man that she'd serve him for life\nShe really doesn't mean to be so inconvenient\n\nSo let's cut to a woman who's lived out a miracle\nMade it through life being less than agreeable\nShe's running for office but battles a bias\nSo to fix it, she's hired the best team of stylists\nThey try her in pantsuits and skirts tailored perfect\nShe stares at the mirror and bleeds through its surface\n\"But why do I need to look pretty to be seen?\nI'm far better qualified and he's just plain mean\"\nWhile he's loud and he's touting a hot wife to gloat\nSo you know that'll earn him the working-class vote.\nThey think that you're old and the polls all reveal\nThat they really won't like you with no sex appeal.\nIt's not really fair, but it's just how things are done.\nSo she pinches her wrinkling skin in her thumb\nAnd thinks, isn't this just inconvenient?\n\nA couple meanders through Sunday brunch tables\nThey pick up some coffee and inspect the bagels\nSomebody approaches an after-church service\nImmediately our young wife becomes nervous\nShe asks if they're planning on having a child\nShe looks at her feet and her manner grows mild\n\"She's trans but that's none of your business here, lady\"\nShe doesn't want kids but the subject of babies\nIt makes her get anxious, she knows that she's valid\nBut her belly's not carrying much more than a salad\nHer husband, defensive, he rubs on her arms\nPolitely replies, it's just not in our cards.\nThe churchgoer's rude and refers to the sermon\n\"No children? Well that's just a waste of a woman\"\nShe relays this story to friends over wine\nAnd they tell her that not wanting children is fine\nShe says, \"Well if you wanted, you could carry your own\"\nBut she doesn't know all their stories at home\nCause some of them spend their nights cursing their wombs\nOver handfuls of pregnancies ended too soon\nBut before they can say they feel inadequate, too\nA fight erupts down in the back of the room\nA black woman storms through the bar in her apron\nIt seems she's in trouble for slapping a patron\nHe put both his hands on her backside and squeezed\nHe said, \"White women really don't got 'em like these!\"\nHer boss is irate and he tells her she's let go\n\"Why can't you behave, yo', you're acting so ghetto\"\nShe tried to defend herself only to find\nA black woman's anger is never in line\nAren't all these women just so inconvenient?\n\nEver since the march I've been asked to write poems\nBut irony proves to be just ever-growin'\nI'm asked to address how to be \"inconvenient\"\nBut before I can speak, first they want me to screen it\nThey're scared that I'll freak out and do something wild!\nBut censorship really just isn't my style\nSome even suggested that they write the speech\nBut how could they say that they do what they preach?\nWith all due respect to these media teams\nI don't get on a stage and not say what I mean\nSo, sorry to Glamour for cursing too often\nBut I've never really been the type that would soften\nA message I'm passionate about in my bones\nSo, if you're offended, and viewing at home\nI'm here to say that I'm not sorry\nFor being inconvenient\nYou were not put on this earth to make everybody else's life easier\nSo please, be inconvenient", "image": "https://images.genius.com/717ef270400fad51b447a232c893c0e7.882x774x1.png"}], "artist": "Halsey"}
