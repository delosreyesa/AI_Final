Or are you misled?\nI gave you the messiest head\nYou give me the messiest head\nOh, you're turnin' red\n'Cause I'm tryna give the impression that I get the message you wish I was dead\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]\nSee you 'bouta break a sweat (I, I, I)\nI won't let us finish yet (I, I, I)\nPlease don't take this as a threat (I, I, I)\nAll I'm sayin' is if you don't love me no more, then\n\n[Chorus: Halsey]\nLie, lie\nLie, lie\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\n(Quavo)\nI heard what you said (What she say?)\nYou talk about your head game (Oh)\nI know that it's fire flame (Fire)\nYour mouth make a hurricane (Splash)\nYou notice that we in love (Love)\nThat's something we cannot change (No)\nIt's the plans we should arrange (Plans)\nTreat her right and she won't complain (Yeah)\nBring back the title (Bring it back)\nShe tall like the Eiffel (Yeah)\nGot no one to lie to (No)\nThere's no need to lie no more (Ayy)\nBring me a trial (Bring)\nEvery move's vital (Ooh)\nWhat you gon' die for\nWhen everything you told lies?
