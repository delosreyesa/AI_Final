Hey, I was just wondering if you wanna like\u2026 never mind. Thank you. Bye...\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour laugh echoes down the highway\nCarves into my hollow chest, spreads over the emptiness\nIt's bliss\nIt's so simple but we can't stay\nOver analyze again, would it really kill you if we kissed?\n\n[Chorus]\nAll we do is drive\nAll we do is think about the feelings that we hide\nAll we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign\nSick and full of pride\nAll we do is drive\n\nAnd California never felt like home to me\nAnd California never felt like home\nAnd California never felt like home to me\nUntil I had you on the open road and now we're singing\n\n[Breakdown]\nAh, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah\nAh, ah, ah-ah, ah ah\nAh, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah ah\nAh, ah, ah-ah, ah ah ah\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/092840365d93c9685b8309a50e46793f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Halsey"}
