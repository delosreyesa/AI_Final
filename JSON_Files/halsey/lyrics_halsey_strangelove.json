Will it be alright?\n\n[Chorus]\nThey think I'm insane, they think my lover is strange\nBut I don't have to fucking tell them anything, anything\nAnd I'm gonna write it all down, and I'm gonna sing it on stage\nBut I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nThat's the beauty of a secret\nYou know you're supposed to keep it\nThat's the beauty of a secret\nOh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh, wa-oh\nThat's the beauty of a secret\nYou know you're supposed to keep it\nBut I don't have to fucking tell you anything, anything", "image": "https://images.genius.com/092840365d93c9685b8309a50e46793f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Halsey"}
