Pretend it's okay\nMy eyes deceive me, but it's still the same\nPretend it's okay\n\n[Verse 1: Perrie & Jade & (Leigh-Anne)]\nI remember the day when we were out all night\nI wish that I could get the day back and tell you it's alright\n(Cause we all do the same thing, we just don't realise)\nThat we're living on borrowed time\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat would you do? What would you say?\nHow does it feel? Pretend it's okay\nMy eyes deceive me, but it's still the same\nPretend it's okay\n\n[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne & Perrie & (All)]\nI see the light that I'm chasing\nA memory, but it's fading\nWhen it's gone, I'll be waiting\n(Knowing it's too late)\nYou chose the road that I'm walking\nNow it's your soul that I'm caught in\nAnd you're not hearing when I'm calling\nCalling your name)\nOne breath, one step, one life, one heart\nTwo words, two eyes, new beginning, new start\n(Too deep, too narrow, too short, too bright\nI'm better with you, here by my side)\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat would you do? What would you say?\nHow does it feel? Pretend it's okay\nMy eyes deceive me, but it's still the same\nPretend it's okay\n\n[Bridge: Jesy & Perrie]\nNothing here, no one talking, knowing it's too late\nBut sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's okay\nNothing here, no one talking, nothing's gonna change\nBut sometimes it can get so hard pretending it's okay\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhat would you do? What would you say?\nHow does it feel? Pretend it's okay\nMy eyes deceive me, but it's still the same\nPretend it's okay\n\n[Chorus: Jade]\nWhat would you do? What would you say?\nHow does it feel? Pretend it's okay\nMy eyes deceive me, but it's still the same\nPretend it's okay", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/7a67c6fbdb8203f600ef9f17e8422a2b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
