So what?\nThat I've been hesitating so long, so long\nSomebody turn out the light\n'Cause right now must be my time to shine\n\n[Chorus: Jade & All]\nThey said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't\nBut if they could see me now\nThey'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing\nAnd the world will hear me shout\nWe sing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nMight call me crazy but I've been thinking maybe\nYou would change your mind\nIf you could see me now\n\n[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne & Perrie]\nDrop me in the ocean, I'll swim\nPut me in with the lions, I'll roar\nThere's a survivor within, so much stronger than I was before\nThey never saw me coming so what? So what?\nCause they been sleeping on me so long, so long\nI'd got to leave that behind\nCause right now must be my time to shine\n\n[Chorus: Jade & All]\nThey said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't\nBut if they could see me now\nThey'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing\nAnd the world will hear me shout\nWe sing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nMight call me crazy but I've been thinking maybe\nYou would change your mind\nIf you could see me now\n\n[Bridge: All & Jade]\nThey said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't\nBut if they could see me now\nThey'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing\nAnd the world will hear me shout\nI'm not scared of\n\n[Chorus: Jade & All]\nThey said I couldn't, they told me that I wouldn't\nBut if they could see me now\nThey'd see I'm something, that I'm not scared of nothing\nAnd the world will hear me shout\nWe sing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nMight call me crazy but I've been thinking maybe\nYou would change your mind\nIf you could see me now", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/3ce1adfa351ed61a2ef4ff84834e7984.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
