Hey!)\n(Okay)\n\n[Verse 1: Jade]\nHey baby, tell me your name\nI got a fever for you\nI just can't explain\nBut there's just one problem\nI'm a bit old school\nWhen it comes to loving\nI ain't chasing you\nAin't waiting\nI'm on a roll\nYou've got to let yourself go\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Perrie]\n(Whoa) You know that I've been waiting for you\n(And I noticed you too)\nDon't leave me standing all by myself\n(I won't leave you standing all alone)\n'Cause I ain't looking at no one else\n(Oh baby!)\n\n[Chorus: Jesy & All]\nHey, get your back off the wall, don't you get comfortable\nLooking so hot, I think that I might fall\nFeeling like it's my birthday, like Christmas day came early\nJust what I want, so when we move, you move\nHey, get your back off the wall, don't you get comfortable\nLooking so hot, I think that I might fall\nFeeling like it's my birthday, like Christmas day came early\nJust what I want, so when we move, you move\n\n[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne]\nOh silly, why you afraid?\nDon't be a big baby, quit playing games\nPut your arms around me, you know what to do\nAnd we can take it down low\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n(Whoa) You know that I've been waiting for you\nDon't leave me standing all by myself\n'Cause I ain't looking at no one else\n(Howoa oh oh)\n\n[Chorus: All]\nGet your back off the wall (Oh!)\nDon't you get comfortable\nLooking so hot\nI think that I might fall\nFeeling like it's my birthday\nLike Christmas day came early\nJust what I want, so\n\n[Bridge: Leigh-Anne]\nI know that you want to\nBut you can't\nBecause you got to stay cool in the corner\nWhen the truth is that you want to move\nSo move\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Perrie]\nMove it baby\nYou know that I've been waiting for you\nDon't leave me standing all by myself\n'Cause I ain't looking at no one else\nLooking at no one else\nLooking at no one else (Ow!)\n\n[Bridge: All]\nHey!
