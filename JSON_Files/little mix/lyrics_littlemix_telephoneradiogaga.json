I can't hear a thing\nI have got no service in the club, you say, say?\nWha-wha-what did you say, are you breaking up on me?\nSorry I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy\nKinda busy, kinda busy\nSorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy\n\n[Chorus: All & Jesy]\nStop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore\nI left my head and my heart on the dancefloor\nStop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore\nI left my head and my heart on the dancefloor\nEh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh\nStop telephoning\nMe me me me me me me\n\n[Verse 2: Jade & Perrie & All]\nBoy, the way you blowing up my phone, won't make me leave no faster\nPut my coat on faster, leave my friends no faster\nShould've left my phone at home cause this is a disaster\nCall me a collector\nSorry, I cannot answer\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Perrie & All]\nNot that I don't like you, I'm just tryna party\nAnd I am sick and tired of my phone ringing\nSometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station\nTonight I'm not taking no calls cause I'll be dancing\nCause I'll be dancing, cause I'll be dancing\nTonight I'm not taking no calls\nCause I'll be dancing\n\n[Chorus: All]\nStop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore\nI left my head and my heart on the dancefloor\nStop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore\nI left my head and my heart on the dancefloor", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75779ccc12434cbd204ae2f037fae9eb.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
