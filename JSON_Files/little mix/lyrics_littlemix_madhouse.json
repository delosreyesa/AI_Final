'Cause I don't want to stay awake\nBut I won't remember a thing\nAnd now it's running through my veins\nI don't know what's happening, beat's so sick\n\n[Chorus: All]\nRunning from the madhouse, they won't take me back\nGot the medicines to give me what I need\nYes, I'm burning up, but music is my drug\nDoesn't matter if I shout or if I scream\nThey're coming for me, they're coming for me\n\n[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne]\nEverywhere I look\nI'm shook, I got bloodshot eyes\nI'm like a fugitive tryna climb the walls\nBut my hands are tied\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2: Jade]\nIn just one touch and I'm infected by the sound\nCrawling all over my skin\nAnd the sky is falling down\nI don't know what's happening, beat's so sick\n\n[Chorus: All (Jade)]\nRunning from the madhouse, they won't take me back\nGot the medicines to give me what I need\nYes, I'm burning up, but music is my drug\nDoesn't matter if I shout or if I scream\nThey're coming for me, Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey\n(They're coming for me)\nHey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey, hey\n(They're coming for me)\n\n[Bridge: All & (Jade) & {\u200b\u200bPerrie}\u200b\u200b]\nOh\nMen in white coats, coats, getting so close, close\nSaying my prayers, don't take me back there\nMen in white coats, coats, getting so close, close\nSaying my prayers don't\n(Take me back, take me back, take me back there)\n{\u200b\u200bThey're, they're coming for me}\u200b\u200b\n\n[Chorus: All]\nRunning from the madhouse, they won't take me back\nGot the medicines to give me what I need\nYes I'm burning up but music is my drug\nDoesn't matter if I shout or if I scream\nThey're coming for me\n\n[Outro: Perrie]\nIt's like I'm running but I just can't find my way\nI don't wanna go back\nAnd they can't hear my voice, no matter how I scream\nThey're coming for me", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/7a67c6fbdb8203f600ef9f17e8422a2b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
