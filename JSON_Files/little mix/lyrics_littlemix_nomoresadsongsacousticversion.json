(Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nI'm beggin', please, don't play\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more!

(Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nI'm beggin', please, don't play (Baby, I am begging, no more)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs) (No mo-oh-re)\nI'm beggin', please, don't play\n\n[Outro: Jade Thirlwall & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]\nNo more sad songs, no more sad songs\nNo more sad songs", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2da2651d5670b8996ddcadd5bd237d42.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
