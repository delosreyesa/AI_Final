What is it with you?\nAlways thinking\nI can do it better, you know I can do it better\nBaby, I can't stand all these arguments\nWhy you want to fight?\n\n[Post-Bridge: Perrie & All]\nWhy you want to fight? You ain't always right\nI can do it better every day and every night\nI can do it better every day and every night\n\n[Chorus: Jade]\nI say it once, you say it twice\nYou know I like a little competition from time to time\nYou think I'm wrong when I know I'm right\nYou lose this ain't no kinda competition, I like a man with ambition\nBut when you gonna know it's time to let go?\nCause I think I'm about to lose my mind", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/3ce1adfa351ed61a2ef4ff84834e7984.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
