gonna be\nCause I can't pretend\nDon't you wanna be more than friends\nHold me tight and don't let go, don't let go\nHave the right to lose control, don't let go\n\n[Don't Let Go: Perrie]\nI often tell myself\nThat we could be more than just friends\nI know you think that if we move too soon\nIt would all end\n\n[Don't Let Go: Leigh-Anne]\nI live in misery when you're not around\nAnd I won't be satisfied 'til we're taking those vows\n\n[Don't Let Go: All]\nThere'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking\nOh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking\nWhat's it gonna be?\n'Cause I can't pretend\nDon't you wanna be more than friends?\nHold me tight and don't let go, don't let go\nHave the right to lose control, don't let go\n\n[Don't Let Go: Jesy]\nRunning in and out my life has got me so confused\n\n[Don't Let Go: Perrie]\nTogether we can make it right\n\n[Don't Let Go: All]\nWhat's it gonna be?\n'Cause I can't pretend\nDon't you wanna be more than friends\nHold me tight and
