I walk forward with a fire that burns so deeply inside, it keeps the darkness away\nI do not need a light at the end of the tunnel, I will light it myself. What am I? I am vulnerable. I give myself too easily\nMy heart leads me down a path that leaves me open to tears. But I will not consider my fears to be a negative\nI will twist and turn them to my advantage\nIt is okay to fall, I will be brave. I am dramatic, you will know I am near. My head is held high, my eyes flaming, my confidence provokes. I will not be low. I will not bow down to anyone. You will know I am here\nWhat am I? I am a lover. Faithful and true. A journey for only two people. My head, my heart, my body, my sanctuary, peace. I am a friend. I surround myself with sisters, a bond that is unbreakable. Inside and out, soul and mind. They exist within me forever. Their tears are my tears, their laughs are my memories. Our smiles and dreams chase any shadow away\nWhat am I? I am a woman, I am an army on my own. Do not mistake my silence for lack of opinion. Do not mistake my kindness for weakness. Join me, we will be strong and dangerous. Together we are an empire. We will all rise as one. I ask you, what is a queen without a king? It makes no difference, she will always be a queen. And I salute all queens\nSalute\nLadies all across the world, listen up, we're looking for recruits\n(Recruits, recruits, recruits, recruits)\nIf you with me, let me see your hands, stand up and salute\n(Salute, salute, salute, salute)\nSalute\nSalute\nSalute\nSalute\nSalute\nSalute\nSalute\nGet your killer heels, sneakers, pumps or lace up your boots\nRepresenting all the women, salute,

you least expect it?\nDoes he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck?\nNo scientist or biology, it's obvious, when he's holding me\nIt's only natural that I'm so affected\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]\nOh, oh, oh, and my heart won't beat again\nIf I can't feel him in my veins\nNo need to question, I already know\n\n[Chorus: All]\nIt's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA, it's in his DNA\nAnd he just takes my breath away, bre-bre-bre-breath away, I feel it every day\nAnd that's what makes a man, not hard to understand\nPerfect in every way, I see it in his face, nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA\n\n[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson with All]\nIt's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future\nFingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah, hey, yeah\nNow I don't have any first degree, but I know what he does to me\nNo need to work it out, it's so familiar, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jade Thirlwall]\nAnd my heart won't beat again\nIf I can't feel him in my veins\nNo need to question, I already know\n\n[Chorus: All]\nIt's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA, it's in his DNA\nAnd he just takes my breath away, bre-bre-bre-breath away, I feel it every day\nAnd that's what makes a man, not hard to understand\nPerfect in every way, I see it in his face, nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA\n\n[Bridge: Leigh-Anne Pinnock with All]\nIt's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips\nOur energy connects, it's simple genetics\nI'm the X to his Y, it's the colour of his eyes\nHe can do no wrong, no, he don't need to try\nMade from the best, he passes all the tests\nGot my heart beating fast, it's cardiac arrest\nHe's from a different strain that science can't explain\nI guess, that's how he's made, in his D-D-DNA\n\n[Breakdown: All]\nAhh-ah-ah-ah\nAhh-ah-ah-ah\nAhh-ah-ah-ah\nAhh-ah-ah-ah\n\n[Chorus: All, Perrie Edwards & Jade Thirlwall]\nWoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh\nIt's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA, it's in his DNA\nAnd he just takes my breath away\nBre-bre-bre-breath away (Breath away, yeah)\nI feel it every day\nAnd that's what makes a man (What makes a man)\nNot hard to understand (To understand)\nPerfect in every way (In every way)\nI see it in his face (It in his face)\nNothing more to say\u2014\n\n[Part 4: \"Freak\"]\n\n[Intro]\n(Shh) Ahhh\n(Shh) Ahhh\n(Shh) Ahhh\nYou don't get these kisses for free (Free\u2014,
