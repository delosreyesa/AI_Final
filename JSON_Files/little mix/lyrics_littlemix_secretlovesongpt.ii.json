'Cause I'm yours\nWhy can't I say that I'm in love?\nI wanna shout it from the rooftops\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours\n\n[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson]\nIt's obvious you're meant for me\nEvery piece of you, it just fits perfectly\nEvery second, every thought, I'm in so deep\nBut I'll never show it on my face\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson]\nBut we know this, we got a love that is hopeless\n\n[Chorus: Perrie Edwards]\nWhy can't you hold me in the street?\nWhy can't I kiss you on the dance floor?\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours\nWhy can't I say that I'm in love?\nI wanna shout it from the rooftops\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours\n\n[Bridge A: Leigh-Anne Pinnock]\nI don't wanna live love this way\nI don't wanna hide us away\nI wonder if it ever will change\nI'm living for that day, someday\n\n[Bridge B: Jesy Nelson]\nWhen you hold me in the street\nAnd you kiss me on the dance floor\nI wish that we could be like that\nWhy can't we we be like that? Cause I'm yours, I'm yours\n\n[Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock & Perrie Edwards]\nOh, why can't you hold me in the street?\nWhy can't I kiss you on the dance floor?\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't it be like that? 'Cause I'm yours\nWhy can't I say that I'm in love?\nI wanna shout it from the rooftops\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't we be like that? 'Cause I'm yours\n\n[Outro: Perrie Edwards]\nWhy can't we be like that?\nWish we could be like that", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f49fecc32b70029800eb9a7dd037b476.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
