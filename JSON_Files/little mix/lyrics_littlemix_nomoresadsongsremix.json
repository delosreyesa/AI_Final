(Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nI'm beggin', please, don't play (Baby, I am begging, no more)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs)\nNo more! (Sad songs) (No mo-oh-re)\nI'm beggin', please, don't play\n\n[Outro: Jade Thirlwall & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]\nNo more sad songs, no, no more sad songs\nNo more sad songs\nNo more sad songs, no, no more sad songs\nNo more sad songs, oh\nNo more sad songs", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ed9087fd3894a9ca96c05df80209217.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
