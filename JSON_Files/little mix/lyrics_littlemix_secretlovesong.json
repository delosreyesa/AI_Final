Cause I'm yours\n\n[Verse 1: Jade Thirlwall & Jesy Nelson]\nWe keep behind closed doors\nEvery time I see you, I die a little more\nStolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls\nIt'll never be enough\nIt's obvious you're meant for me\nEvery piece of you, it just fits perfectly\nEvery second, every thought, I'm in so deep\nBut I'll never show it on my face\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson]\nBut we know this, we got a love that is hopeless\n\n[Chorus: Perrie Edwards]\nWhy can't you hold me in the street?\nWhy can't I kiss you on the dance floor?\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours\n\n[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]\nWhen you're with him, do you call his name\nLike you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?\nWould you leave if I was ready to settle down?\nOr would you play it safe and stay?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]\nGirl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless\n\n[Chorus: Perrie Edwards & Jason Derulo]\nWhy can't you hold me in the street?\nWhy can't I kiss you on the dance floor?\nI wish that it could be like that\nWhy can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours\n\n[Bridge A: Jason Derulo & Leigh-Anne Pinnock]\nAnd nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby\nI don't wanna hide us away\nTell the world about the love we making\nI'm living for that day, someday\n\n[Bridge B: Jason Derulo & Jesy Nelson]\nWhy can't I hold you in the street?\nWhy can't I kiss you on the dance floor?\nI wish that we could be like that\nWhy can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours, I'm yours\n\n[Chorus: Leigh-Anne Pinnock + Jason Derulo]\nOh, why can't you hold me in the street?\nWhy can't I kiss you on the dance floor?\nI wish that it could be like that (I wish)\nWhy can't it be like that?  (I wish) Cause I'm yours\n\n[Chorus Reprise: Perrie Edwards + Jason Derulo]\nWhy can't I say that I'm in love?\nI wanna shout it from the rooftops\nI wish that it could be like that (I wish)\nWhy can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours\n\n[Outro: Jade Thirlwall]\nWhy can't we be like that?\nWish we could be like that", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8aab2d62aeedba0f269c3c9e4466f82e.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
