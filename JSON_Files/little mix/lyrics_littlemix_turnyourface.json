What do we have to lose?\nSince I'm already losing you\n\n[Chorus: Leigh-Anne & Perrie]\nSo hard to face that I can't feel you anymore\nHard to face that I can't see you anymore\nSo walk away until you're not standing at my door\nTurn your face, walk away, and stay, turn your face\n\n[Outro: Perrie]\nTurn your face, and stay\nTurn your face", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/7a67c6fbdb8203f600ef9f17e8422a2b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Little Mix"}
