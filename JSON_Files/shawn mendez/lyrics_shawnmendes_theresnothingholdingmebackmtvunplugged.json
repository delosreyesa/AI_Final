(we would be alright)\n'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far\nI know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright\nIf you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark\nI know we'd be alright, we would be alright\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I've been shaking\nI love it when you go crazy\nYou take all my inhibitions\n(Baby), there's nothing holding me back\nYou take me places that tear up my reputation\nSing it out! (Manipulate my decisions)\nBaby, there's nothing holding me back\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nThere's nothing holding me back\nThere's nothing holding me back\n\n[Postlude]\nThank you so much", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a52e79d5a965dc1dd29fbe805eb1e528.699x699x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Shawn Mendes"}
