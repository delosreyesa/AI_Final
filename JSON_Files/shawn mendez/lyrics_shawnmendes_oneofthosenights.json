We don\u2019t know\nFollow the wind, where it blows\nLet\u2019s make mistakes and don\u2019t look back\nIt\u2019s now or never\n\n[Chorus]\nOne of those nights we felt invincible\nAnd every glass was full, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, dancing in the stars\nThought that the world was ours, one of those nights\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe\u2019re young livin' with no fear\nKids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears\nWe don\u2019t have this time for long\nYeah, we make big plans, spending all our change\nCaught up in the night, oh, we missed the last train\nIt\u2019s that time, and we\u2019re leaving, home\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhere do we go? We don\u2019t know\nFollow the wind, where it blows\nLet\u2019s make mistakes and don\u2019t look back\nIt\u2019s now or never\n\n[Chorus]\nOne of those nights we felt invincible\nAnd every glass was full, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, dancing in the stars\nThought that the world was ours, one of those nights\n\n[Refrain]\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\n\n[Bridge]\nGo home it\u2019s over, but it\u2019s not the end\nDon\u2019t wait \u2018til you\u2019re older to begin\nKeep your composure and innocence\nWhere do we go? We don\u2019t know\nOne of those nights, we\u2019re driving around\nIn this boring ass town\nOne of those nights\n\n[Refrain]\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\n\n[Chorus]\nOne of those nights we felt invincible\nAnd every glass was full, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, dancing in the stars\nThought that the world was ours, one of those nights\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, where she turns the lights down\nAnd it\u2019s only us now, one of those nights", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2f338c537c89d1ded89c79e513d6e925.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Shawn Mendes"}
