(Baby?)\nYou didn't leave your number for me\nLeft me without a warning, waitin' (Waitin')\nWhere were you in the morning, baby?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]\nHow do you, how do you just walk away? (Away)\nHow do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)\n\n[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes]\nAnd I thought you really felt this\nWhen we were talking about breakfast\nYou made it seem like we connected\nI guess I just didn't expect this\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]\nHow could you make me believe? (Believe)\nThat there was something in between you and me, yeah\nI look around and I don't see you\n\n[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]\nWhere were you in the morning, baby? (Baby)\nYou didn't leave your number for me\nLeft me without a warning, waitin'\nI said where were you in the morning, baby?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]\nHow do you, how do you just walk away?\nWhere were, where were you?\nHow do you, how do you just walk away?\nWhere were, where were you?\n\n[Bridge: Shawn Mendes]\nAnd I hope you had a good reason\n'Cause I know you had a good time\nAnd I'm looking up at the ceiling\nAnd I keep wondering why (Why)\n\n[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]\nWhere were you in the morning, baby?\nWhere were you in the morning?\nYou didn't leave your number for me\nDidn't leave your number\nLeft me without a warning, waitin'\nLeft me without a warning\nI said, where were you in the morning baby?\nWhere were you in the morning?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes]\nHow do you, how do you just walk away?\nWhere were, where were you?\nHow do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)\nWhere were, where were you?\nHow do you, how do you just walk away?
