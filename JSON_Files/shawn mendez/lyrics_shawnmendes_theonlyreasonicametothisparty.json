What you been up to?\nIt's killing me slowly\nWhen all I wanna do Is get a second with you\nThe music's too loud, just wanna hear the sound of you singing softly\nWe can leave now, we got nothing to lose\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPeople everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd\nUntil we walk right out of here\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the only reason I came to this party\nSo, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody\nEverybody's wasted on their phones\nI wanna find a place we can be alone\n'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party\nI came to this party\nI came to this party, yeah\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're the only reason I came to this party\nSo, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody\nEverybody's wasted on their phones\nI wanna find a place we can be alone\nYou're the only reason I come to this party\nI came to this party, yeah\nI came to this party\nI came to this party\n'Cause you're the only reason I came to this party\nI came to this party", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b1264a57f3b31d7c84dbbd2e6534818.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "Shawn Mendes"}
