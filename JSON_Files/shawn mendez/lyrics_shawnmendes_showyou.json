Really, really, gotta show you now?\nDo I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out\nDo you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds\nI don\u2019t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud\nDo I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?\nDo I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out\nDo you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds\nI don\u2019t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I will walk this road ahead\nOne hundred miles on my hands\nDo I need to show you?\nGuess I gotta show you\nAnd if you don't believe me now\nI'll flip the whole world upside down\nDo I need to show you?\nGuess I gotta show you\n\n[Outro]\nDo I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?\nDo I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out\nDo you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds\nDo I need to show you?
