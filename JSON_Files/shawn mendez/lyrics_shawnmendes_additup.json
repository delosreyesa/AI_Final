Add it up! Add it up!\nWait a minute honey, I'm add it up!\nAdd it up! Add it up! Add it up!\n\n(Verse 2)\nDay after day\nI get angry and I will say\nThat the day is in my sight\nWhen I'll take a bow\nAnd say goodnight\n\n(Bridge)\nOh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum\nTake a look now at what your boy has done\nHe's walking around like he's number one\nWent downtown and bought him a gun\n\nSo don't you shoot that thing at me\nDon't you shoot that thing at me\nYou know you got my sympathy\nBut don't you shoot that thing at me\n\n(Verse 3)\nDay after day\nI get angry and I will say\nThat the day is in my sight\nWhen I'll take a bow\nAnd say goodnight\n\nAdd it up! Add it up!\nWait a minute honey, I'm add it up!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b1264a57f3b31d7c84dbbd2e6534818.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "Shawn Mendes"}
