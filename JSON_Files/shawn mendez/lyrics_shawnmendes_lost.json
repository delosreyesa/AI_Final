If we're all here together then why are we watching alone?\nThe world's so much bigger than posing for pictures\nIf all that we need's at the tips of our fingers then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHold on, time out, help me\n\n[Chorus]\nCause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open\nNothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves\nAnd yeah, disconnection has caught my attention\nI don't wanna share this with anybody else\nI wanna get lost\n\n[Bridge]\nTell me how it feels cause I know the hardest part\nIs when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark\nI'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part\nIf you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open\nNothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves\nAnd yeah, disconnection has caught my attention\nI don't wanna share this with anybody else\nI wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open\nNothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves\nAnd yeah, disconnection has caught my attention\nI don't wanna share this with anybody else\nI wanna get lost, I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8964d15473f1d39a25d317f07273ffc5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Shawn Mendes"}
