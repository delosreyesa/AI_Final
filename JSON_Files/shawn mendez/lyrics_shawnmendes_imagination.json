(Woah, oh)\n\n[Bridge]\nImagination (Woah, oh, woah, oh)\nImagination (Woah, oh)\n(Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, ooh)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be\nAnd from there, who knows?\nMaybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time\nOr is that just me and my imagination?\n\n[Outro]\nI keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true\nCan't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8964d15473f1d39a25d317f07273ffc5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Shawn Mendes"}
