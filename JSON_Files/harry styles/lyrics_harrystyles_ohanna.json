(Oh, Anna!)\nEvery time I see your face, there\u2019s only so much I can take\nOh! (Oh, Anna!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon\u2019t know how you taste when\nThere\u2019s smoke in your perfume\nChew me up and spit me out\nNothing left to lose\n\n[Chorus]\nI don\u2019t want your sympathy, but you don\u2019t know what you do to me\nOh! (Oh, Anna!)\nEvery time I see your face, there\u2019s only so much I can take\nOh! (Oh, Anna!)\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nI don\u2019t want your sympathy, but you don\u2019t know what you do to me\nOh, Anna!

(Oh, Anna!)\nEvery time I see your face, there\u2019s only so much I can take\nOh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)\n\n[Guitar Solo + \"Faith\" Interpolation]\nWell I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body\nIf I could touch your body\nIf I could touch your body\nIf I could touch your body\n\n[Chorus]\nI don\u2019t want your sympathy, but you\u2019ll never know what you do to me\nOh, Anna! (Oh, Anna!)\nEvery time I see your face, there\u2019s only so much I can take\nOh, Anna!
