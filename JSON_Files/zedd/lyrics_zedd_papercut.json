Oh, oh\nCause I never meant to hurt you, and I know you feel the same\nStill the only one I run to, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nRight now it feels like we're bleeding\nSo deep that we might not get back up\nOur words, they tear through the surface\nLike a paper, like a paper cut\nRight now, don't know why I love you\nBut by the morning, when we wake up\nI'll reach for you and remember\nIt was just a paper, just a paper cut\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nRight now it feels like we're bleeding\nSo deep that we might not get back up\nOur words, they tear through the surface\nLike a paper, like a paper cut\nRight now, don't know why I love you\nBut by the morning, when we wake up\nI'll reach for you and remember\nIt was just a paper, just a paper cut\nJust a paper, just a paper cut\nJust a paper, just a paper cut\nJust a paper, just a paper cut", "image": "https://images.genius.com/47f54642965d4d8c1cadb99ee0d116a6.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Zedd"}
