I still see your ghost\n\n[Chorus]\nSo what do I do now?\nI don't keep love around\nSo what do I do now?\nI don't keep love around\nWhat do I do now?\nI don't keep love around, love around\nLove around, love around\n\n[Bridge: Troye Sivan]\nI don't keep love around, ye-eah\nI don't keep love around, ooh yeah\nI don't keep love around\nLove around\nLove around\n\n[Verse 3: Tkay Maidza]\nThey can't stand, I handstand\nDon't hold on right anymore\nPleased to meet you, I'm kinda moved\nBut that last one was my antidote\nGreen eyes, become green times\nBut there is no first or a last chance\nThey're telling me to turn down\n'Cause I'm so lit, recall Flash Dance?\nOnly A1 and I stay 1\nAnd I'm counting out for that day when\nResiduals become imminent\nCause failure is not pivotal\nThey just be asking the same\nTry switch it up, I switch lanes\nNo love in this world, I\u2019m still sane\nRight? Because that's enough?\nWhen the light on and you don't keep love\n\n[Outro: Troye Sivan]\n\"Distance makes the heart grow fonder\u2019\"\nSaid by someone stronger than me\nSo what do I do now? Do now?\nSo what do I do now?\nI don't keep love around anymore\nI don't keep love around anymore\nI don't keep, I don't keep\nLove around", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cc42c0f3b0d4f3fda2f9a07a60b9ce9a.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Troye Sivan"}
