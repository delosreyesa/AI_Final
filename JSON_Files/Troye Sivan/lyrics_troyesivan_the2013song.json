I like boys\nHave you seen their butts? Exactly)\n\nRobin Thicke went to Number 1\nEven though the song was sexist and dumb\nYeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines\nBut oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes\n\nEverybody says she went a bit koo-koo\nTelling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo\nWe say she's the one who's going cray\nBut here we are asking What The Fox Say?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh and I, don't know how to feel\nJust like that, 2013, it's been real\nOh and I, think I just shed a tear\n2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe US Government needed a break\nProbably to go do the Harlem Shake\nCatching Fire was good, dudes\nGot me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes\n\nThe 1D boys said This Is Us\nBeyonce dropped an album without a fuss\nRest in peace to Nelson Mandela\nTo you Madiba, we're indebted forever\n\n[Chorus]\nOh and I, don't know how to feel\nJust like that, 2013, it's been real\nOh and I, think I just shed a tear\n2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year\n\nOh and I, don't know how to feel\nJust like that, 2013, it's been real\nOh and I, think I just shed a tear\n2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15713527e1ac7e3842f7ad1ba1623961.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Troye Sivan"}
