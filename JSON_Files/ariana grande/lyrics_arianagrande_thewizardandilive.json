No\nHe'll say to me, \"I see who you truly are\nA girl on whom I can rely\"\nAnd that's how we'll begin\nThe Wizard and I\n\nOnce I'm with the Wizard\nMy whole life will change\nCause once you're with the Wizard\nNo one thinks you're strange\nNo father is not proud of you\nNo sister acts ashamed\nAnd all of Oz has to love you\nWhen by the Wizard, you're acclaimed\nAnd this gift or this curse I have inside\nMaybe at last, I'll know why\nWhen we are hand in hand\nThe Wizard and I\n\nOne day, he'll say to me\n\"Elphaba, a girl who is so superior\nShouldn't a girl who's so good inside\nHave a matching exterior?\nAnd since folks here to an absurd degree\nSeem fixated on your verdigris\nWould it be alright by you\nIf I de-greenify you?\"\nAnd though of course, that's not important to me\n\"All right, why not?\" I'll reply\nOh, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and I\nYes, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and...\n\nUnlimited\nMy future is unlimited\nAnd I've just had a vision\nAlmost like a prophecy, I know\nIt sounds truly crazy\nAnd true, the vision's hazy\nBut I swear, someday there'll be\nA celebration throughout Oz\nThat's all to do with me\n\nAnd I'll stand there with the Wizard\nFeeling things I've never felt\nAnd though I'd never show it\nI'd be so happy, I could melt\nAnd so it will be for the rest of my life\nAnd I'll want nothing else 'til I die\nHeld in such high esteem\nWhen people see me, they will scream\nFor half of Oz's favorite team, oh\nThe Wizard and I", "image": "https://images.genius.com/93c4a8d8138efe5378fcd43668becc7b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ariana Grande"}
