were born this way, baby\n\nMy mama told me when I was young\nWe are all born superstars\nShe rolled my hair and put my lipstick on\nIn the glass of her boudoir\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are\"\nShe said, \"'Cause he made you perfect, babe.\"\n\"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far\nListen to me when I say.\"\n\nI'm beautiful in my way\n'Cause God makes no mistakes\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\nDon't hide yourself in regret\nJust love yourself and you're set\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way (born this way)\n\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nBaby, I was born this way (born this way)\n\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\nDon't be a drag, just be a queen\nDon't be a drag, just be a queen\nDon't be a drag, just be a queen\n(Don't be, don't be, don't be)\n\nGive yourself prudence and love your friends\nSubway kid, rejoice your truth\nIn the religion of the insecure\nI must be myself, respect my youth\n\nA different lover is not a sin\nBelieve capital H-I-M, hey\nI love my life, I love this record and\nMi amore vole fe yah (Love needs faith)\n\nI'm beautiful in my way\n'Cause God makes no mistakes\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\nDon't hide yourself in regret\nJust love yourself and you're set\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nBaby, I was born this way (born this way)\n\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\n(Don't be)\nDon't be a drag, just be a queen\nWhether you're broke or evergreen\nYou're black, white, beige, chola descent\nYou're Lebanese, you're orient\n\nWhether life's disabilities\nLeft you outcast, bullied or teased\nRejoice and love yourself today\n'Cause baby you were born this way\n\nNo matter gay, straight or bi\nLesbian, transgendered life\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born to survive\n\nNo matter black, white or beige\nChola or orient made\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born to be brave\n\nI'm beautiful in my way\n'Cause God makes no mistakes\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\nDon't hide yourself in regret\nJust love yourself and you're set\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way, yeah\n\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nBaby, I was born this way (born this way)\n\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\nI was born this way, hey\nI was born this way, hey\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way, hey\n\nI was born this way, hey\nI was born this way, hey\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way, hey\n\nSame D.N.A\nBut born this way\nSame D.N.A\nBut born this way\n\n[Intro]\nCome on girls\nDo you believe in love?\nCause I got something to say about it\nAnd it goes something like this\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDon't go for second best, baby\nPut your love to the test\nYou know, you know, you've got to\nMake him express how he feels\nAnd maybe then you'll know your love is real\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou don't need diamond rings\nOr eighteen karat gold\nFancy cars that go very fast\nYou know they never last, no no\nWhat you need is a big strong hand\nTo lift you to your higher ground\nMake you feel like a queen on a throne\nMake him love you till you can't come down\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDon't go for second best, baby\nPut your love to the test\nYou know, you know, you've got to\nMake him express how he feels\nAnd maybe then you'll know your love is real\n\n[Verse 2]\nLong stem roses are the way to your heart\nBut he needs to start with your head\nSatin sheets are very romantic\nWhat happens when you're not there?\nYou deserve the best in life\nSo if the time isn't right, then move on\nSecond best is never enough\nYou'll do much better, baby, on your own\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDon't go for second best, baby\nPut your love to the test\nYou know, you know, you've got to\nMake him express how he feels\nAnd maybe then you'll know your love is real\n\n[Chorus 2]\nExpress yourself\nYou've got to make him express himself\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nSo if you want it right now, make him show you how\nExpress what he's got, oh baby, ready or not\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd when you're gone he might regret it\nThink about the love he once had\nTry to carry on, but he just won't get it\nHe'll be back on his knees\n\n[Breakdown]\nTo express himself\nYou've got to make him express himself\nHey hey\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat you need is a big strong hand\nTo lift you to your higher ground\nMake you feel like a queen on a throne\nMake him love you till you can't come down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c070997a928b38158111c394f795af3.756x756x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ariana Grande"}
