I felt it wasn\u2019t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are\u2026. I think that\u2019s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good\n\nI will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character (and she is) but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book\u2026\u2026 she wouldn\u2019t judge anybody by their appearance\u2026. she believed the best in people\u2026. she wasn\u2019t afraid of anything or anybody\u2026. she never let people\u2019s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted\u2026 she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real (which is something I personally do all the time but I wish I could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does)\n\nOne of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that\u2019s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way\n\nSo I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some \u2018dumb\u2019 kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us\n\nHopefully we\u2019ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I\u2019d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They\u2019d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)\n\nThank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn\u2019t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can\u2019t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted\n\nLastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started\u2026 you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We\u2019ve been through so much and you are still here\u2026 and we\u2019ve got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c070997a928b38158111c394f795af3.756x756x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ariana Grande"}
