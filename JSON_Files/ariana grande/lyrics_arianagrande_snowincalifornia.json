I'll even settle for rain\nDon't want him to go tomorrow morning\nGive me something to make him stay\nWrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California\n\n[Verse 2]\nDear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?\nI checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day\nMake it go away\nSee I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days\nCan't you make his five o'clock flight delay?\nWon't you find a way?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh yeah\nThis year can you...\n\n[Chorus]\nJust make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain\nDon't want him to go tomorrow morning\nGive me something to make him stay\nWrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California\n\n[Bridge]\nI know I'm asking for the impossible, but I believe in miracles\nI need my baby right here with me, so please, please\n\n[Chorus]\nJust make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain\nDon't want him to go tomorrow morning\nGive me something to make him stay\nWrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ea6778fb0ef09a0a7318cff3eda1b6b.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Ariana Grande"}
