It's what I always wanted\nCould never have too many of these\nWill you quit kicking me under the table\nI'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?\nCan we settle down please?\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's that time of year\nLeave all our hopelessnesses aside\n(If just for a little while)\nTears stop right here\nI know we've all had a bumpy ride\n(I'm secretly on your side)\n\n[Interlude]\nBite tongue, deep breaths\nCount to ten, nod your head\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think something is burning\nNow you've ruined the whole thing\nMuffle the smoke alarm\nWhoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it\nPour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's that time of year\nLeave all our hopelessnesses aside\n(If just for a little while)\nTears stop right here\nI know we've all had a bumpy ride\n(I'm secretly on your side)\n\n[Bridge]\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\n\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\n\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\n\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\n\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\nGet me out of here\n\nGet me out of...\n\n[Outro]\nJust for now, just for now...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c070997a928b38158111c394f795af3.756x756x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ariana Grande"}
