Did I leave it in the cold?\nSo please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take\nIt must've fell when I lost my mind\nSo deep in the cut, drowning in a pain\nSomebody help, 'cause I can't find my way\nNobody move, nobody move\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel\nWhen I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real\nI've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on\nSo where were you when I needed you the most?\nWhy in the hell would I give my heart to you?\nJust to watch you throw it in the trash\nSo now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest\nA heartless, broken mess", "image": "https://images.genius.com/65d0c6a93fe91f678044b90c32acaa9d.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ariana Grande"}
