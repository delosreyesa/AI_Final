(Serious)\n\n[Verse 2]\nCalling me up, so late at night\nAre we just friends?\nYou say you wanted me, but you're sleeping with him\nYou think of me, I'm what you see\nWhen you look at the sky\nI don't believe you\nYou ain't been loving me right, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm just on the floor, I'm like a model\nBeen looking through the texts and all the photos\nBut don't you worry, I can handle it\nNo, don't you worry, I can handle it\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you let him touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya\nThe way I used to, used to, used to, used to, used to, used to\nIf you let him touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya, touch ya\nThe way I used to, used to, used to, used to, used to, used to\nDid you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?\nForget to bring a jacket, wrap up in him 'cause you wanted to?\nI'm just curious, is it serious?
