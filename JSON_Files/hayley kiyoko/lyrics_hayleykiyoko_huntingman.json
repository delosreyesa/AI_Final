You are a hunting man\nYou set a cage and I bleed\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I keep on running fast\nFar away from your needs\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You keep on coming back\nYou keep on coming back for me\n\nI keep holding on\nTo things I had before\nI keep saving it for you\nI keep saving me for you\n\nOh I know I was blind\nCause I made you mine\nStop wanting me\nStop wanting me for favors\n\nAnd oh-oh we don't talk\nAnd no-oh you can not\nPlay me all you want\nI'm no game\n\nThese woods I walk around I'm walking out\nCause I've seen this coming from behind the corner\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You are a hunting man\nYou set a cage and I bleed\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I keep on running fast\nFar away from your needs\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You keep on coming back\nYou keep on coming back for me\n\nI keep holding on\nTo what I knew was gone\nI keep waiting for you\nI keep saving me for you\n\nOh I know I was blind\nCause I made you mine\nStop calling me, stop calling me\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You are the a hunting man\nYou set a cage and I bleed\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You got me running fast\nFar away from your needs\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You keep on coming back\nYou keep on coming back for me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f83f8014504505a3313c94862b70e.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hayley Kiyoko"}
