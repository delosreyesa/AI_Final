Gotta get with you\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlways gonna steal your thunder\nWatch me like a dark cloud\nOn the move collecting numbers\nI'ma take your girl out\nWe will be everything that we'd ever need\nDon't tell me, tell me what I feel\nI'm real and I don't feel like boys\nI'm real and I don't feel like boys\n\n[Chorus]\nSaw your face, heard your name, gotta get with you\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new\nIsn't this why we came? Gotta get with you\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new\n\n[Bridge]\nI've been crossing all the lines, all the lines\nKissed your girls and made you cry, boys\n\n[Chorus]\nSaw your face, heard your name, gotta get with you\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new\nIsn't this why we came? Tell me if you feel it too!\nTell me, girls like girls like boys do, nothing new\nGirls like girls like boys do, nothing new", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75e0446241105b79e43239b6eadd1965.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hayley Kiyoko"}
