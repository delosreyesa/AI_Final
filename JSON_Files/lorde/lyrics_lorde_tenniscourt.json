(Yeah)\nI'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)\nAnd you can watch from your window (Yeah)\nAnd you can watch from your window\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears\nIt's a new art form showing people how little we care (Yeah)\nWe're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nAnd talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nLet's go down to the tennis court and talk it up like \"yeah\" (Yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1198c05ff75cf77c23ec127901a0c25f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lorde"}
