It's time the kid got free\n\n[Chorus]\nBe a part of the love club\nEverything will glow for you\nGo get punched for the love club\nFor the love club\n\n[Verse 2]\nI joined the club and it's all on\nThere are fights for being my best friend\nAnd the girls get their claws out\nThere's somethin' about hanging out with the wicked kids\nTake the pill, make it too ill\nThe other day I forgot my old address\nI'm sittin' pretty on the throne, there's nothing more I want\nExcept to be alone\n\n[Chorus]\nBe a part of the love club\nEverything will glow for you\nGo get punched for the love club\nFor the love club\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(For the love club)\n(For the love club)\n(For the love club)\n\n[Bridge]\nYour clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go\nSo drop your chin and take yourself back home\nAnd roll out your maps and papers\nFind out your hidin' places again\nThe only problem that I got with the club\nIs how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up\nWhen you're a member, go on your great adventure again\nAnd we'll be waiting at the end\n\n[Chorus]\nBe a part of the love club\nEverything will glow for you\nGo get punched for the love club\nFor the love club\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(For the love club)\n(For the love club)\n(For the love club)\n(For the love club)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5dc15f80d47f543fd996a6902aaf1967.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lorde"}
