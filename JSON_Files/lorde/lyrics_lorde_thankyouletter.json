HOLY CRAP\n\nIt was a crazy day & my friends and family over here are still freaking out. I just wanted to say thank you for the time you've given me these past 14 months. Finding out about me online or in between these pages or in your headphones\n\nWithout your support, there's no way I would ever have gotten to stand in the middle of the Staples Centre & perform in my school shoes\n\nI can't wait for tonight's show. Together we'll make it magic. I'll see you there\n\nXxx L", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2fd0bb1affd9235323dfed76a982644.393x393x1.png"}], "artist": "Lorde"}
