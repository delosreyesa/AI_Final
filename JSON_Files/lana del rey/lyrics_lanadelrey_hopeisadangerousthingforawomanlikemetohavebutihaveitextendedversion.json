Are you real? Are you real? Yeah? Is there any chance that I'm just gonna wake up on the floor and this song won't exist? I'll be very sad. If I wake up and you don't exist and this song doesn't exist... Yeah, I hope you're real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/45af17a72cac836e3cbe090d84feccb8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
