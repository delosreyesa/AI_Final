Hello?\nCa-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you want to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all\nI've nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSummertime is nice and hot\nAnd my life is sweet like vanilla is\nGold and silver-lined my heart\nBut burned into my brain are these stolen images\nStolen images, baby, stolen images\nCan you picture it?\nBabe, that life, we could've lived\n\n[Chorus]\nHello? Hello?\nCa-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you like to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all\nI've nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\n\n[Bridge]\nWe were two kids just tryin' to get out\nLived on the dark side of the American dream\nWe would dance all night, play our music loud\nBut when we grew up, nothing was what it seemed\n\n[Chorus]\nHello? Hello?\nCa-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you like to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all\nI've nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\nHello? Hello?\nCa-can you hear me?\nI can be your china doll if you like to see me fall\nBoy, you're so dope, your love is deadly\nTell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all\nI've nothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing without you\nAll my dreams and all the lights mean\nNothing if I can't have you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5c18bf853fc76f2f6697abbd2adb0587.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
