Covering the surfs of the Earth were seas, and the seas were turmoil. With civilization there came the surfer with his urge to conquer these moving walls of water.\n\n[\"Doin' Time\" Snippet]\nSummertime,\u200a and the livin's easy\nBradley's\u200a on the microphone with Ras MG\nAll the people in the dance will agree\nThat we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C\nMe,\u200a me and Louie, we gonna run to the party\nAnd\u200a dance to the rhythm, it gets harder\n\n[\"Venice Bitch\" Snippet]\nOh God, miss you on my lips\nIt's\u200a me, your little Venice bitch\nOn the stoop with the neighborhood kids\nCallin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss\nYou're in the yard, I light the fire\nAnd\u200a as the summer fades away\nNothing gold can stay\n\n[\"Mariners Apartment Complex\" Snippet]\nYou lose your way, just take my hand\nYou're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again\nDon't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am\n\n[\"Norman Fucking Rockwell\" Snippet]\nGoddamn, man-child\nYou fucked me so good that I almost said ''I love you\"\nYou're fun and you're wild\nBut you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through\nYour poetry's bad and you blame the news\nBut I can't change that, and I can't change your mood\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nThe greatest journey is the journey of the mind since this is what determines the journey of life. Have you ever had the feeling that your mind is on a journey? A voyage of discovery? That sometimes it has to make long passages on dark, uncharted seas? And at other times it discovers bright islands of beauty or of truth. Islands it will know from this day forward, that it can always steer for and find in the storm while the gales of life blow themselves out and the enormous seas of misfortune, or pain, or sorrow, or doubt subside in the calm. Well, if you'll come, I'd like to take you with me on such a voyage of the mind.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51f8bfc1133dda7a49791f347f60c9a3.720x720x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
