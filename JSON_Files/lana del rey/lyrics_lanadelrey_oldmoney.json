Where did you go?\nThose summer nights seem long ago\nAnd so is the girl you used to call\nThe Queen of New York City\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if you send for me, you know I'll come\nAnd if you call for me, you know I'll run\nI'll run to you, I'll run to you\nI'll run, run, run\nI'll come to you, I'll come to you\nI'll come, come, come\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe power of youth is on my mind\nSunsets, small town, I'm out of time\nWill you still love me when I shine?\nFrom words but not from beauty\nMy father's love was always strong\nMy mother's glamour lives on and on\nYet still inside, I felt alone\nFor reasons unknown to me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if you send for me, you know I'll come\nAnd if you call for me, you know I'll run\nI'll run to you, I'll run to you\nI'll run, run, run\nI'll come to you, I'll come to you\nI'll come, come, come\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd if you call, I'll run, run, run\nIf you change your mind, I'll come, come, come\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\n[Outro]\nBlue hydrangea, cold cash divine\nCashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine\nRed racing cars, Sunset and Vine\nAnd we were young and pretty", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f5c69b48fb143d720ba08227e5526c68.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
