(nobody)\nWho has a choice like smarty does?\nNobody, nobody, nobody\n\n[Bridge]\nSay I make you feel like Christmas time\nSay I make you feel like Christmas time\nTell me you don't feel like Christmas time\nPut me in a party dress, my, mine\n\n[Verse 1]\nBaby, if you loved me, you would call me your bunny\nTell me that I'm just a baby, honey\nBeat me and tell me no one will love me\nBetter than you do\nBetter than you do\nDance me all around the room\nDance me around the room\nKeep out the stars, turn out the lights\nThis little world is yours tonight\nDance me all around the room\nSay you'll never leave me\n\n[Chorus]\nWho has a face like smarty does?\nWho has a voice like smarty does?\nWho has a choice like smarty does?\nNobody, nobody, nobody\nWho has a face like smarty does?\nWho has a voice like smarty does?
