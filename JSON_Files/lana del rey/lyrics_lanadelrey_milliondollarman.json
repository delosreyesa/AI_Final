I don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nYou look like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got the world, but baby, at what price?\nIt's something so strange, it's hard to define\nIt isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you\nI'd follow you down, down, down, 'cause you're unbelievable\nIf you're going crazy, just grab me and take me\nI'd follow you down, down, down; anywhere, anywhere\n\n[Chorus]\nOne for the money, two for the show\nI love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go\nHow did you get that way? I don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nYou look like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus]\nOne for the money, two for the show\nI love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go\nHow did you get that way? I don't know\nYou're screwed up and brilliant\nYou look like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?\n\n[Outro]\nI don't know\nYou're screwed up, you're brilliant\nYou look like a million dollar man\nSo why is my heart broke?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5c18bf853fc76f2f6697abbd2adb0587.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
