I'm feeling hot to the touch\nYou say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much\nBut something keeps me really quiet\nI'm alive, I'm a lush\nHold me close you say, hush baby hush\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see my baby swingin'\nHis Parliament's on fire and his hands are up\nOn the balcony and I'm singing\nOoh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love\nI can see my sweet boy swayin'\nHe's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love\nOn the balcony and I'm saying\nMove baby, move baby, I'm in love\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see my baby swingin'\nHis Parliament's on fire and his hands are up\nOn the balcony and I'm singing\nOoh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love\nI can see my sweet boy swayin'\nHe's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love\nOn the balcony and I'm saying\nMove baby, move baby, I'm in love\n\n[Outro]\nI'm in love\nI'm in love\nI'm in love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82e9f7f047703ab59fd53db4dedb0734.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
