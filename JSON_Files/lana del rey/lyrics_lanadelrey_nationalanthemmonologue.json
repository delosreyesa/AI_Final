Try to remember what\nwe had at the beginning. He was charismatic, magnetic,\nelectric and everybody knew it. When he walked in\nevery woman's head turned, everyone stood up\nto talk to him. He was like this hybrid, this mix of\na man who couldn't contain himself.\nI always got the sense that he became torn\nbetween being a good person and\nmissing out on all of the opportunities that life could\noffer a man as magnificent as him.\nAnd in that way I understood him\nand I loved him.\nI loved him, I loved him, I loved him.\nAnd I still love him.\nI love him.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82e9f7f047703ab59fd53db4dedb0734.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
