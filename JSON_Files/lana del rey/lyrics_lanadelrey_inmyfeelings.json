Who's freer than me?\nYou wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby\nI'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm smokin' while I'm runnin'\nThis town and you better believe it, honey\nI'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners\nAnd taking down names\nI'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'\nIn the smoke they can hear me comin'\nIf you were me, and I was you\nI'd get out of my way\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGet that cigarette smoke out of my face\nYou've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine\nWell, you know what you're doin'\nTalk that talk, well, now they all know your name\nAnd there's no comin' back from the place that you came\nBaby, don't do it\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you got me in my feelings\n(Got me feeling so much right now)\nTalkin' in my sleep again\n(I'm makin' no sense at all)\nTalkin' while I'm screamin'\n(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)\nWho's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?\nYou wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby\nI'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings\n\n[Bridge]\nGot me up in this place right now\nMakin' no sense at all\nGot me up in this place right now, against the wall\nGot me feelin' so blue\nMakin' no sense at all\nGotta leave right now\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you got me in my feelings\n(Got me feeling so much right now)\nTalkin' in my sleep again\n(I'm makin' no sense at all)\nTalkin' while I'm screamin'\n(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)\nWho's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?\nYou wanna make the switch?
