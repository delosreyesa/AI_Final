Penny for your thoughts\nThose lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox\nBut don't ask me why, just swallow some wine\nWi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sean Lennon]\nStay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise\nIn the Tropic of Cancer\n'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay\nAnd you'd be my tiny dancer, baby\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]\nI waited for you\nIn the spot you said to wait\nIn the city, on the park bench\nIn the middle of the pourin' rain\n'Cause I adored you\nAnd I just wanted things to be the same\nYou said you'd meet me up there tomorrow\nBut tomorrow never came\nTomorrow never came\n\n[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, Both]\nRoses out in your country house\nWe played guitar in your barn\nAnd everyday felt like Sunday\nAnd I, I wish we had stayed home\nAnd I could put on the radio to our favorite song\nLennon and Yoko, we would play all day long\n\"Isn't life crazy?\", I said now that I'm singin' with Sean\nWhoa\n\n[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]\nI could keep waitin' for you\nIn the spot we always wait\nIn the city, on the park bench\nIn the summer, on the pourin' rain\nHoney, don't ignore me\nI just wanted it to be the same\nYou said you'd love me like no tomorrow\nI guess tomorrow never came (No, no, no)\nTomorrow never came (No, no)\nTomorrow never came (No, no, no)\nTomorrow never came", "image": "https://images.genius.com/161aab04cf223819eb628dae7447576c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
