No, stop\nI don't want to hear another word about your 'Why not's'\nI bought your bullshit all before, now you trying to sell me more, babe?\n\n[Chorus]\nMan who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose\nSold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose\nI'm tired, tired of singing the blues\nI'm tired\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking\nIt's just another white girl day, hey ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down\nA double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now\nI want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up\nI don't want to know another thing you think you know about me\nI'm not who you think I am, smiling, but I ain't happy\n\n[Chorus]\nMan who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose\nSold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose\nI'm tired, tired of singing the blues\nI'm tired\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, I'm so far gone, I can't turn off my mind\nIt's like a ticking time bomb\nTrying to kill me from inside\nHaunting day and night\nIs there no remedy for memory?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've felt this way before I've known the depths of utter desperation\nMy boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation\nI know that he's right but I don't care tonight\nI want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop\nI keep running around the same town, knocking you down, I'm fucked\nHow can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?\n\n[Chorus]\nA man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose\nSold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose\nI'm tired, tired of singing the blues\nI'm tired", "image": "https://images.genius.com/055eb2f13540611f9f6c5f7571037915.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
