{"songs": [{"title": "Lust For Life [Album Trailer]", "album": null, "year": "2017-03-29", "lyrics": "You know, in this town an artist really needs a lot of space when they're trying to create something special. A place to cultivate a world of their own, far away from the real world that's around them.\n\nLuckily for me, I live right inside the middle of the 'H' of the Hollywood sign, and this is how I spent most of my nights: perched high above the chaos that swirls within the City of Angels below. Now don't get me wrong, I love to dip my toe into the muck and the mires of the city every now and then, especially on Tuesdays. But truthfully, when I'm in the middle of making a record - especially now, when the world is in the middle of such a tumultuous period - I find I really need to take the space for myself, far away from real life to consider what my contribution to the world should be in these dark times.\n\nSo each morning I have the luxury of asking myself, \"What shall I cook up for the kids today? Something with a little spice? Something with a little bitterness but is ultimately sweet? Or shall I take the day off and turn down the fire, and just take a moment to send my love to them over the ether?\" Because sometimes just being pure of heart, and having good intentions, and letting them be known is the most worthy contribution an artist can make.\n\nSo, even though these times can feel a little bit crazy, they're not so very different from what other generations have experienced at one time or another before. Amidst all the uncertainty, and as we transition out of one era into another one, there's no place I'd rather be than smack-dab in the middle of 'Hollyweird' making this record for you. Because you and the music, and this place are my love, my light, and my lust for life.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/142337a8bdaa81bf7f42538adeddfbbd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
