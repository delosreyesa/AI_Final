Flowers in my hair\nDo you love me? You, yes you over there\nEverybody asks me who I am\nI'm nobody, I'm only a man\n\nAnd I got nothing better, but my sleeve\nIf life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave\nSo I say \"run motorcycle run\"\nRun motorcycle run\nRun motorcycle run\nRun motorcycle run", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b21ea302476b21991a60ba5b5c8ed9a0.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
