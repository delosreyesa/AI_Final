(Laughs)\nNo, with seriousness, are you ready? Ladies...\n\n(All the money, feel my temperature rising)\n\n[Interlude 5: Lana Del Rey]\nI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked\nDragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix\nAngel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night\nWho poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz\nWho bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated\nWho passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war\nWho were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull\nWho cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall\nWho got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York\nWho ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night\nWith dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares\n\n[Robbery]\n\nAnd so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil\nLos Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate\nSome poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost\n\n[Interlude 1 - Variation: Lana Del Rey]\nDear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins\nMaster of the Universe, creator of all forgive us our sins\nDear John forgive us our sins, dear John\n\n[Spoken 2: John Wayne]\nYou ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain\nHave you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?\nHave you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?\nOr watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?\nHave you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines\nOr heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?\nDoes the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?\nOr do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore\nBrave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?\nAnd do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?\nHave you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?\nOr seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?\nDo you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea\nOr bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?\nYou ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:\nIt's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky\n\n[Bel Air]\n\n[Instrumental Outro]", "image": "https://i.genius.com/cb62fdba9dfe55047bce687303c0202a75cfcb51?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.clicrbs.com.br%2Fcodevilla%2Ffiles%2F2013%2F07%2Fmusic-lana-del-rey-tropico-poster.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
