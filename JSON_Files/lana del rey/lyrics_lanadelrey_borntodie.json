(Hey, man!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nFeet don't fail me now\nTake me to the finish line\nOh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take\nBut I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine\nWalking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?\nI feel so alone on a Friday night\nCan you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?\nIt's like I told you, honey (alright)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough\nI don't know why\nKeep making me laugh \u2013 Let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus]\nCome, take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\n\n[Verse 2]\nLost, but now I am found\nI can see, but once I was blind\nI was so confused as a little child\nTried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find\nAll the answers, honey\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough\nI don't know why\nKeep making me laugh \u2013 Let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus]\nCome, take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\nWe were born to die\nWe were born to die\n\n[Bridge]\nCome, take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDon't make me sad, don't make me cry\nSometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough\nI don't know why\nKeep making me laugh \u2013 Let's go get high\nThe road is long, we carry on\nTry to have fun in the meantime\n\n[Chorus]\nCome, take a walk on the wild side\nLet me kiss you hard in the pouring rain\nYou like your girls insane\nChoose your last words, this is the last time\n'Cause you and I, we were born to die\nWe were born to die\nWe were born to die\n(We were born to die)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c9f8c1b9a4ce0ebf171b27734de2ea60.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
