Nectar of the gods\nHeroin gold in my veins, you in my thoughts\nI'm on the freeway racing at a million\nAnd I just can\u2019t stop\nI call you up twice, hang up the phone\nCall again, I wanna talk\n\n[Chorus]\nI get wild on you baby\nI get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew\nKnew, knew, knew\nI get wild on you baby\nI get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat sweet world is this? Honey on the vine\nSchool kid dreams came true then passed in the night\nI used to dream about people like you\nNow I don't know why\nI used to sing about people like you\nNow I just get high\n\n[Chorus]\nI get wild on you baby\nI get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew\nKnew, knew, knew\nI get wild on you baby\nI get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Interlude]\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nI get wild on you baby\nI get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew\nKnew, knew, knew\nI get wild on you baby\nI get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Outro]\nCaliforn-I-A, homeland of the gods\nOnce I found my way, but now I'm lost", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82e9f7f047703ab59fd53db4dedb0734.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lana Del Rey"}
