Is it easier to go?\nI don't wanna know, oh\nI know that I'm never, ever gonna change\nAnd you know that you're always gonna stay the same\nIs it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?\nI don't wanna know, oh\nI know that I'm never, ever gonna change\nAnd you know you don't want it any other way\n\n[Verse 2: Luke]\nEvery time that you say you're gonna leave\nThat's when you get the very best of me\nYou know we need it like the air we breathe\nAir we breathe, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]\nI love you so much that I hate you\nRight now, it's so hard to blame you\n'Cause you're so damn beautiful\n\n[Chorus: Luke, with All]\nIs it easier to stay?
