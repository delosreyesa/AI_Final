Who am I when I don't know myself?\nWho am I? Who am I? Invisible\n\n[Verse 2: Calum]\nWasted days, dreaming of the times I know I can't get back\nSeems I just lost track\nLooking on as all of life's colours seem to fade to grey\nI just walked away\n\n[Chorus: Calum]\nI was already missing before the night I left\nJust me and your shadow and all of my regrets\nWho am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?\nWho am I? Who am I? Invisible\n\nWho am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?\nWho am I? Who am I? Invisible\nWho am I? Who am I when I don't know myself?\nWho am I? Who am I? Invisible\n\n[Outro: Calum]\nAnother day, the walls are built to keep me safe\nI can't escape, it's too late", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25eebd8c1542608ee5cb8852f0621db6.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
