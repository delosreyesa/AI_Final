We're all going home\nAnd it won't be long, won't be long, won't be long\nYou know it's gonna get better, you know it's gonna get better\n\n[Bridge: Luke & Calum]\nI got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter\nSo close to the other side, so far from the wonder\nI got one foot in the golden life, one foot in the gutter\nSo sick of the tug of war, it keeps pulling me under\n\n[Chorus: All]\nLet the good times roll\nLet the good times roll\n\n[Verse 2: Luke]\nCarry on, outlast the ignorance\nMoving on, survive the innocence\nWon't be long, won't be long, won't be long\nYou know it's gonna get better", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25eebd8c1542608ee5cb8852f0621db6.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
