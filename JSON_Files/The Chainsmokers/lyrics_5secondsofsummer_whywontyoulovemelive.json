Why?\n\n[Verse 1: Luke]\nSwitching into airplane mode again\nWe're not alright but I'll pretend\nPress my cheek against the glass\nJust be good 'til I get back\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke]\nThe ground disappears\nI hold back the tears\nI check my phone to see your face\nStaring back as if to say\nDon't worry, you won't be lonely\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhy won't you love me?\nWhy won't you love me?\nYou imagine when you close your eyes\nYou're with me on the other side\nSo why won't you love me?\n\n[Verse 2: Calum & Michael]\nFew drinks deep at a table for one\nThe place we like to go and you take yourself home again\nThree missed calls at 2 AM\nYou say you never heard, you're late to get to work and then\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Calum & Michael]\nThe time disappears\nYou hold back the tears\nYour best girlfriend just got engaged\nYou say you can't wait and need to make a change\nYou told me it's so hard to be lonely\n\n[Chorus: All]\nWhy won't you love me?\nWhy won't you love me?\nWe're together all alone tonight\nSo helpless from the other side\nSo why won't you love me?\n\n[Bridge: All]\nCan you tell me why, my love? Can you tell me why?\nI hold on to you and you hold on to me\nCan you tell me why, my love? Can you tell me why?\nI hold on to you and you hold on\n\n[Chorus: Luke & All]\nWhy won't you love me?\nWhy won't you love me?\nWhy won't you love me?\nYou imagine when you close your eyes\nYou're with me on the other side\nSo why won't you love me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/137618a58483ba07da764d0dd6585e03.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
