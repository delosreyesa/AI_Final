(what?)\nI don't understand what's happened\nI keep saying things I never say\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Michael]\nI can feel you watching\nEven when you're nowhere to be seen\nI can feel you touching\nEven when you're far away from me\n\n[Chorus: Calum]\nTell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll\n'Cause I can't control myself\nI don't wanna stay, I wanna run away\nBut I'm trapped under your spell\nAnd it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest\nAnd I'm having trouble catching my breath\nOoh, ooh\nWon't you please stop loving me to death?\n\n[Verse 2: Luke]\nI don't even see my friends no more\n'Cause I keep hanging out with you\nI don't know how you kept me up all night\nOr how I got this tattoo\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Michael]\nI can feel you watching\nEven when you're nowhere to be seen\nAnd I can feel you touching\nEven when you're far away from me\n\n[Chorus: Calum]\nTell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll\n'Cause I can't control myself\nI don't wanna stay, I wanna run away\nBut I'm trapped under your spell\nAnd it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest\nAnd I'm having trouble catching my breath\nOoh, ooh\nWon't you please stop loving me to death?\n\n[Bridge: Luke]\nEvery time you're near me\nSuddenly my heart begins to race\nEvery time I leave\nI don't know why my heart begins to break\n\n[Chorus: Calum]\nTell me where you're hiding your voodoo doll\n'Cause I can't control myself\nI don't wanna stay, I wanna run away\nBut I'm trapped under your spell\nAnd it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest\nAnd I'm having trouble catching my breath\nOoh, ooh\nWon't you please stop loving me to death?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6ae4bed69d2171861deba4acf212c953.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
