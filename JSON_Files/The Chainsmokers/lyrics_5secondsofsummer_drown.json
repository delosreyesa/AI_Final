Dive in when I\u2019m down?\nSave me from myself, don\u2019t let me drown\nWho will make me fight? Drag me out alive?\nSave me from myself, don\u2019t let me drown\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat doesn\u2019t destroy you leaves you broken instead\nGot a hole in my soul growin\u2019 deeper and deeper\nAnd I can\u2019t take\nOne more moment of this silence, the loneliness is hauntin\u2019 me\nAnd the weight of the world\u2019s gettin\u2019 harder to hold up\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt comes in waves, I close my eyes\nHold my breath and let it bury me\nI\u2019m not okay and it\u2019s not alright\nWon\u2019t you drag the lake and bring me home again?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho will fix me now? Dive in when I\u2019m down?\nSave me from myself, don\u2019t let me drown\nWho will make me fight? Drag me out alive?\nSave me from myself, don\u2019t let me drown\n\n[Bridge]\n\u2018Cause you know that I can\u2019t do this on my own\n\u2018Cause you know that I can\u2019t do this on my own\n\u2018Cause you know that I can\u2019t do this on my own\n(\u2018Cause you know that I can\u2019t do this on my\u2013)\n\n[Outro]\nWho will fix me now? Who will fix me now?\nWho will fix me now? Dive in when I\u2019m down?\nSave me from myself, don\u2019t let me drown", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9b0eb71596c6296b254dbe7140b2fcca.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
