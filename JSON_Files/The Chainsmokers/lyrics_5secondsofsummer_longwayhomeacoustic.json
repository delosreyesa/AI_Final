The fireflies and make-believe\nKicking back in the old school yard, singing songs on our guitars\nThis is our reality, crazy stupid, you and me\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke]\nWe know this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be\n\n[Chorus: All & Luke]\nSo we\u2019re taking the long way home\nCause I don\u2019t wanna be wasting my time alone\nI wanna get lost and drive forever with you, talking 'bout nothing, yeah whatever baby\nSo we\u2019re taking the long way home tonight\nWe\u2019re taking the long way home\n\n[Verse 2: Michael]\nNow we\u2019re stuck in the middle of nowhere, yeah you know we took our time to get there\nWe're hiding out in a dream, catching fire like kerosene\nAnd you know I\u2019d never let you down, 'til the sun comes up, we can own this town\nSomething like make-believe, living in a movie scene\n\n[Pre-Chorus: All]\nWe know this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be\n\n[Chorus: All]\nSo we\u2019re taking the long way home\nCause I don\u2019t wanna be wasting my time alone\nI wanna get lost and drive forever with you, talking 'bout nothing, yeah whatever baby\nSo we\u2019re taking the long way home\n\n[Bridge: Calum]\nHitting every red light, kissing at the stop signs, darling\nGreen Day\u2019s on the radio\nAnd everything is alright, now we\u2019re turning off the headlights, darling\nWe're just taking it slow\n\n[Chorus: Luke & All]\nSo we\u2019re taking the long way home\nCause I don\u2019t wanna be wasting my time alone\nI wanna get lost and drive forever with you, talking 'bout nothing, yeah whatever baby\nSo we\u2019re taking the long way home\n\n[Bridge: Calum]\nHitting every red light, kissing at the stop signs, darling\nGreen Day\u2019s on the radio\nAnd everything is alright, now we\u2019re turning off the headlights, darling\nWe're just taking it slow\n\n[Outro: Luke]\nWe're taking the long way home\nWe're taking the long way home\nWe're taking the long way home", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f142af00cc066c43fcad26f54dd5f428.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
