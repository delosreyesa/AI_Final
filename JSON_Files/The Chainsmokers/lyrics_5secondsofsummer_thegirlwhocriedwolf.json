Always running\nFind a way to call it quits again\n\n[Chorus: Ashton]\nSo look at me in the eye\nIs anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all?\n'Cause I'm not dreaming\nSo look at me in the eye\nIs anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all?\n'Cause I'm not leaving\n\n[Verse 2: Calum & Luke]\nDoes it have to be this tragedy? This endless lost parade\nA castle of fa\u00e7ade and make believe\nThe truth is spelled out in your eyes\nWhy don't you just reach out and make it clear to me?\nWhat are you telling me?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke]\nYou say you wanna, but do you wanna run away?\nYour great escape, oh yeah\nWhere you going? Always running\nFind a way to call it quits again\n\n[Chorus: Ashton]\nSo look at me in the eye\nIs anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all?\n'Cause I'm not dreaming\nSo look at me in the eye\nIs anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all?\n'Cause I'm not leaving\n\n[Bridge: Michael & Calum]\nIs anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there? Is anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all? 'Cause I'm not dreaming\nIs anyone there at all? Is anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there? Is anyone there at all?\n\n[Outro: Michael]\nLook at me in the eye\nIs anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all?\nI'm not dreaming\nLook at me in the eye\nIs anyone there at all?\nIs anyone there at all?\n'Cause I'm not leaving", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25eebd8c1542608ee5cb8852f0621db6.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
