So bad\nIs it weird if I'm drunk and on my sofa?\nIs it weird if I'm naked on my sofa?\nAll alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya\nIs it weird? So weird\n\n[Pre Chorus: Luke, (Crowd)]\nI know I\u2019m the stupid one who ended it\nAnd now I'm the stupid one regretting it\nIt took me a couple drinks to admit it\nGo!\n(I know I\u2019m the stupid one)\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been filling empty beds just like me?\nThinking about you lots, lately\nOr are you moving along?\n\n[Verse 2: Luke, (Crowd)]\nIs it wrong if I ask you to come over?\nIs it wrong if I tell you that I love ya?\nEven though I'd never do it when I'm sober\nIs it wrong? So (wrong)\n\n[Pre Chorus: Luke, (Crowd)]\nI know I\u2019m the stupid one who ended it\nAnd now I'm the stupid one regretting it\nIt took me a couple drinks (to admit it)\nGo!\n(I know I\u2019m the stupid one)\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been filling empty beds just like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\n\n[Bridge: Ashton & Luke, (Crowd)]\nScared of moving on, but you're already gone\nSo if you\u2019re moving on\nLet me hear you sing this next one c'mon\n(Scared of moving on, but you\u2019re already gone\nSo if you\u2019re moving on, won't you just tell me)\nLet me hear you [?]\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\nThinking about you lots lately\nHave you been filling empty beds just like me?\nThinking about you lots lately\nOr are you moving along?\n\n[Outro: Michael & Luke]\nAnd scared of moving on, but you're already gone\nSo if you\u2019re moving on\nAre you moving along?\nLondon!\n\n[Dialogue: Luke, (Crowd)]\nLondon make some noise right now\nHow we feeling tonight, we feeling good?\nWe are 5 Seconds of Summer\nWelcome to the Meet You There Tour\nI need you to sing with me\nCan you sing with me right now?\nLet me hear you say ooh oh\nGo!\n(ooh oh)\nLet me hear you say oh ooh oh\nGo!\n(oh ooh oh)\nLet me hear you say ooh oh\nGo!\n(ooh oh)\nAnd again say ooh oh\nGo!\n(ooh oh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/137618a58483ba07da764d0dd6585e03.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
