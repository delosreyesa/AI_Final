(go) (go)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLet you go, let you go\nLet you go, let you go\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHolding out hope for you\nHolding out hope, holding out hope for you\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYou were there for me, and I was there for you\nI remember times like that\nYou will always be the one that I regret\nHow will I let you go?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLet you go, let you go\nLet you go, let you go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/be3043bf879485a422e0cb24d167ab94.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Chainsmokers"}
