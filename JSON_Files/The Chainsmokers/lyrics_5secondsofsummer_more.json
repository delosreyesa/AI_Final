Feel alone?\nA house that's full of everything we wanted\nBut it's an empty home, empty home\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke]\nWhy can't we choose our emotion?\n'Cause we could feel something's broken\nAnd I can't stay without hoping\nWe'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh\n\n[Chorus: Luke & All]\nAnd all the things that we dream about\nThey don't mean what they did before\nI just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nWhy does it feel like we're missing out?\nLike I'm standing behind the door\nI just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\n\n[Verse 2: Calum]\n'Cause lately we've been living in different nations\nEnemy lines are drawn, lines are drawn\nWe're speaking different tongues communicating\nRight through the bedroom wall, bedroom wall\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Calum]\nAnd as we fall, time is frozen\nI know we break, but we're not broken\n'Cause I can't stay without hoping\nWe'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh\n\n[Chorus: Luke & All]\nAnd all the things that we dream about\nThey don't mean what they did before\nI just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nWhy does it feel like we're missing out?\nLike I'm standing behind the door\nI just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nAnd all the things that we dream about\nThey don't mean what they did before\nI just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nWhy does it feel like we're missing out?\nLike I'm standing behind the door\nI just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3bbdb780e13454b43619d007032e07bc.905x905x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
