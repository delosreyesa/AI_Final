This song's for you, it goes like this\n(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)\n\n[Verse 1: Luke & Calum]\nI think you're pretty without any make-up on\nI think you're funny when you tell the punch line wrong\nI know you got me\nSo I'll let my walls come down, down\nBefore you met me, I was alright\nBut things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life\nNow every February\nYou'll be my valentine, valentine\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke]\nSo let's go all the way tonight\nNo regrets, just love\nWe can dance until we die\nYou and I, we'll be young forever\n\n[Chorus: All]\nYou make me feel like\nI'm living a teenage dream, the way you turn me on\nI can't sleep, let's run away\nAnd don't ever look back, don't ever look back\nCause my heart stops when you look at me\nJust one touch, now baby I believe\nThis is real, let's take a chance\nAnd don't ever look back, don't ever look back\n\n[Verse 3: Calum]\nWe drove to LA, got drunk on the beach\nGot a motel and built a house out of sheets\nI finally got you, my missing puzzle piece\nI'm complete\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke]\nSo let's go all the way tonight\nNo regrets, just love\nWe can dance until we die\nYou and I, here we go, we'll be young forever\n\n[Chorus: All]\nYou make me feel like\nI'm living a teenage dream, the way you turn me on\nI can't sleep, let's run away\nAnd don't ever look back, don't ever look back\nCause my heart stops when you look at me\nJust one touch, now baby I believe\nThis is real, let's take a chance\nAnd don't ever look back, don't ever look back\n\n[Bridge: Michael, Luke & Ashton]\nCause I can feel your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans\nBe your teenage dream tonight\nLet you rest your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans\nBe your teenage dream tonight\nLos Angeles, if you know the words please sing them\nOne, two, three\n\n[Chorus: All]\nYou make me feel like\nI'm living a teenage dream, the way you turn me on\nI can't sleep, let's run away\nAnd don't ever look back, don't ever look back\nCause my heart stops when you look at me\nJust one touch, now baby I believe\nThis is real, let's take a chance\nAnd don't ever look back, don't ever look back\n\n[Outro: Michael & Ashton]\nNext song we're gonna play is about girls and goes like this\nCooties", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec48a1f6fa4a86bf06dd677514cd1fb1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
