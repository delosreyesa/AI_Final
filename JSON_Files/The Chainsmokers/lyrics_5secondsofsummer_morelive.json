Feel alone?\nA house that's full of everything we wanted\nBut it's an empty home, empty home\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Luke & (Crowd)]\nWhy can't we choose our emotion?\n'Cause we could feel something's broken\nAnd I can't stay without hoping\nWe'll never be alone, we'll never be (alone, oh)\n\n[Chorus: Luke, All & (Crowd)]\n(And all the things that we dream about\nThey don't mean what they did before)\n'Cause I just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nWhy does it feel like we're missing out?\nLike I'm standing behind the door\n'Cause I just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\n\n[Verse 2: Calum]\n'Cause lately we've been living in different nations\nEnemy lines are drawn, lines are drawn\nWe're speaking different tongues communicating\nRight through the bedroom wall, bedroom wall\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Calum]\nAnd as we fall, time is frozen\nI know we break, but we're not broken\n'Cause I can't stay without hoping\nWe'll never be alone, we'll never be alone, oh\n\n[Chorus: Luke, All & (Crowd)]\nAnd all the things that we dream about\nThey don't mean what they did before\n'Cause I just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nWhy does it feel like we're missing out?\nLike I'm standing behind the door\n'Cause I just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\n\nAnd all the things that we dream about\nThey don't mean what they did before\n'Cause I just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nWhy does it feel like we're missing out?\nLike I'm standing behind the door\n'Cause I just wanna get back to us\n'Cause we used to have more\nOhh, oh, oh\nOhh, oh, ohh\n\n[Outro: Luke & (Crowd)]\nOne more time, let me hear you sing!\n(Ohh, oh, oh\nOhh, oh), ohh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/137618a58483ba07da764d0dd6585e03.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
