I don't know\nBet you've never seen a frown like this before\nI was told to always look at things a little different\nSee my demons through kaleidoscopes\nHere goes some advice I found\nSay it with me, scream it loud\nDon't let nothing bring you down\nAnd out, and out\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\n'Cause every night\nI convince myself it's all in my head\nMaybe none of this is real life\nOr maybe I'm just not feeling it yet\nSo every time\nI hear the voices scream inside of my head\nI let 'em know if this is real life\nWe're on our own, so we better be friends\n\n[Drop: Juice WRLD]\nOh, ah, ah\nOh, ah, ah\nOh, ah, ah\nOh, ah, ah\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\n\u2018Cause every night\nI convince myself it\u2019s all in my head\nMaybe none of this is real life\nOr maybe I\u2019m just not feeling it yet\nSo every time\nI hear the voices scream inside of my head\nI let \u2018em know if this is real life\nWe\u2019re on our own, so we better be friends\n\n[Drop: Juice WRLD]\nOh, ah, ah\nOh, ah, ah\nOh, ah, ah\nOh, ah, ah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3196ce432749b3940089fbd47e10825d.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "The Chainsmokers"}
