Your heart's a trick\nAnd all the magic we felt was just a hit\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Winona Oak & Andrew Taggart]\nHard and heavy whiskey goodbyes\nBoy, you know how to make a girl cry\nWas sleeping in a bed full of lies\nAnd now that I'm older, I can see why\n\n[Chorus: Winona Oak & Andrew Taggart]\nYou made me feel high\n'Cause you had me so low, low, low\nYou only seemed tall\n'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth\nI only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you\nNow that I know (Now that I know)\nThat wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope\n\n[Post-Chorus: Winona Oak]\nThat wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50f63df8eb9028c792c09f6cd38e9c00.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Chainsmokers"}
