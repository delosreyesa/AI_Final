Can you tell me why?\nI hold on to you and you hold on to me\nCan you tell me why, my love? Can you tell me why?\nI hold on to you and you hold on\n\n[Chorus: Luke & All]\nWhy won't you love me?\nWhy won't you love me?\nWhy won't you love me?\nYou imagine when you close your eyes\nYou're with me on the other side\nSo why won't you love me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3bbdb780e13454b43619d007032e07bc.905x905x1.jpg"}], "artist": "5 Seconds of Summer"}
