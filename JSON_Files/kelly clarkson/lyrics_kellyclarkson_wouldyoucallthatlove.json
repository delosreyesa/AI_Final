(No)\nWould you, would you call that love? (No)\nWould you, would you call that love?\nWould you, would you call that love?\nWould you, would you call that love?\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, would you call that love?\nMmm, would you call that love?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b0908b5e6d42d75b9e2d5bc910f599eb.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
