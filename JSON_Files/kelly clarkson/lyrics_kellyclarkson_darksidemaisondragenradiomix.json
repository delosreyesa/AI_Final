Even if it hurts\nEven if I try to push you out, will you return?\nAnd remind me who I really am\nPlease remind me who I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's got a dark side\nDo you love me? Can you love mine?\nNobody's a picture perfect\nBut we're worth it\nYou know that we're worth it\nWill you love me?\nEven with my dark side?\n\n[Verse 3]\nLike a diamond from black dust\nIt's hard to know what can become if you give up\nSo don't give up on me\nPlease remind me who I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's got a dark side\nDo you love me? Can you love mine?\nNobody's a picture perfect\nBut we're worth it\nYou know that we're worth it\nWill you love me?\nEven with my dark side?\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't run away, don't run away\nJust tell me that you will stay\nPromise me you will stay\nDon't run away, don't run away\nJust promise me you will stay\nPromise me you will stay\nWill you love me? Ohh...\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's got a dark side\nDo you love me? Can you love mine?\nNobody's a picture perfect\nBut we're worth it\nYou know that we're worth it\nWill you love me?\nEven with my dark side?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de27ccb448a6bc5ab0ed3e314d886536.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
