Did you? Did you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou didn't have to fall\nI didn't need your tears\nI didn't want your pity\nJust any feeling at all would have been sufficient\nI never felt so small, so insignificant\nYou left me naked with nothing at all\nHow could I be so blind?\n\n[Chorus]\nDid you ever care for me?\nDid you ever believe in me?\nDid you ever love me?\nDid you? Did you? Did you?\n\n[Bridge]\nFalling down\nDarkness surrounds me\nI open my eyes\nI bow my head and cry\nDid you ever believe in me?\nDid you ever even love me?\n\n[Chorus]\nDid you ever care for me?\nDid you ever believe in me?\nDid you ever love me?\nDid you? Did you? Did you?\n\n[Outro]\nDid you ever care for me?\nDid you ever love me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c5662e7b745598a397152e1ca78dcd0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
