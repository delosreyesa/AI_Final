(Same side)\nWe could be beautiful without the mistake\nOf our war paint\n'Cause we could be beautiful without our war paint\n(With our war paint) Our war paint\nAnd we could have it all once we let our walls break\nOur walls break\n(We could have it all) Why in the hell do we fight on the front line (The front line)\nWhen we both know that we're here on the same side?\nWe could be beautiful without the mistake\nOf our war paint\n\n[Outro]\nOur war paint", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e969522da843e16e81c525d58b7585a9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
