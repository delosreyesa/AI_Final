Stay till the darkness leaves\nStay here with me\nI know you're busy, I know I'm just one\nBut you might be the only one who sees me\nThe only one to save me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nWhy is it so hard?\nWhy can't you just take me?\nI don't have much to go\nBefore I fade completely\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan you feel how cold I am?\nDo you cry as I do?\nAre you lonely up there all by yourself?\nLike I have felt all my life\nThe only one to save mine\n\n[Chorus 2]\nHow are you so strong?\nWhat's it like to feel so free?\nYour heart is really somethin'\nYour love, a complete mystery to me\n\n[Verse 4]\nAre you there watching me\nAs I lie here on this floor?\nDo you cry, do you cry with me?\nCry with me tonight\n\n[Outro]\nAre you there?\nAre you watching me?", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/kelly_clarkosn_-_my_december_cover.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
