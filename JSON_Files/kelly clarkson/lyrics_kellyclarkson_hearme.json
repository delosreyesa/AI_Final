(Are you listening?)\n\n[Chorus]\nHear me\nI'm cryin' out, I'm ready now\nTurn my world upside down\nFind me\nI'm lost inside the crowd, it's getting loud\nI need you to see, I'm screaming for you to please\nHear me\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm restless and wild\nI fall, but I try\nI need someone to understand (Can you hear me?)\nI'm lost in my thoughts\nAnd baby, I've fought for all that I've got\nCan you hear me?\n\n[Chorus]\nHear me\nI'm cryin' out, I'm ready now\nTurn my world upside down\nFind me\nI'm lost inside the crowd, it's getting loud\nI need you to see\nI'm screaming for you to please\nHear me\nHear me\nHear me\nHear me\nCan you hear me?\nHear me\nHear me\nHear me\nCan you hear me?\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nHear me\nHear me\nHear me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f41d7e6d613ad331377c460c638cdb0e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
