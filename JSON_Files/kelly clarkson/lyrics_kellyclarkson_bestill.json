We're missing so much, babe\nJust lay in my arms for a while\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nAnd be still\nWe should've known\n\n[Chorus]\nFoolish one with the smile, you don't have to be brave\nI'll gladly climb your walls, if you'll meet me halfway\nEvery time we fall down, but we're falling from grace\nHere's my hand and my heart, it's yours to take\n\n[Outro]\nBe still\nBe still\nBe still\nBe still\nBe, be still", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/kelly_clarkosn_-_my_december_cover.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
