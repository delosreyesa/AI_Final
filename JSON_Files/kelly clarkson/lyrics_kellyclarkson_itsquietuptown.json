It's quiet uptown\nHe is trying to do the unimaginable\nIf you see him walking in the park, long after dark\nTaking in the sights of the city\nLook around, look around, look around\nThey are trying to do the unimaginable\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere are moments that the words don't reach\nThere's a grace too powerful to name\nWe push away what we could never understand\nWe push away the unimaginable\nThey are standing in the garden\nStanding there side by side\nShe takes his hand\nIt's quiet uptown\nForgiveness, can you imagine?\nForgiveness, can you imagine?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you see him in the street, walking by her side\nTalking by her side, have pity\nLook around, look around\nThey are going through the unimaginable", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ddd36cfe52ebd587314cd5a5962dacb.1000x886x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
