Oh\nBecause I don't wanna have to go\nAnd be the one to leave you holding on alone\nBut this, this is my goodbye\n\n[Outro]\nSo why don't you try?\nOoh yeah\nYeah\nWhy don't ya?\nWhy don't you try?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4beb5f83eac80ac1c315b51794e6a06b.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
