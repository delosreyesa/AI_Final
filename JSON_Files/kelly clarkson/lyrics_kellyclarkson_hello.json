(Hello)\nLet go, as everyone lets go of me\nOh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone? (Won't somebody, won't somebody?)\nHello\nIs anybody listening?\nLet go, as everyone lets go of me\nOh-oh, won't somebody show me that I'm not alone, not alone? (Show me that I'm not alone)\nNo, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/48542f6235a76b521e9c8010918cf1af.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
