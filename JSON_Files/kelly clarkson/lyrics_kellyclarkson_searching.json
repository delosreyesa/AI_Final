Where are you?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't I find someone who loves me, needs me, feels me\nOoh, oh\nWhy do I waste all of my time on little boys who can't keep up with me\nOh, why, why, why, why\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere are you? Where are you?\nI'm feeling tired\nI need you here with me, oh\nWhy can't I just find you\nSomeone who knows me\nWon't you please find me, find me, no?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy can't I find someone who loves me, needs me, feels me\nOoh, oh\nWhy do I waste all of my time on little boys who can't keep up with me\nOh, no, no\nNo, why do I waste all my time, all my time, ooh\nOh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c5662e7b745598a397152e1ca78dcd0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
