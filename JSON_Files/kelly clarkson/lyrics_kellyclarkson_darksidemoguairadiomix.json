Even if it hurts\nEven if I try to push you out, will you return?\nAnd remind me who I really am\nPlease remind me who I really am\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's got a dark side\nA dark side, a dark side\nEverybody's got a dark side\nA dark side, a dark side\nNobody's a picture perfect\nBut we're worth it\nYou know that we're worth it\nWill you love me?\nWill you love me?\nEverybody's got a dark side\nDo you love me? Can you love mine?\nNobody's a picture perfect\nBut we're worth it\nYou know that we're worth it\nWill you love me?\nWill you love me?\n\n[Drop]\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody's got a dark side\nA dark side, a dark side\nNobody's a picture perfect\nBut we're worth it\nYou know that we're worth it\nWill you love me?\nWill you love me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b4071d90fe5a5da9a10aac9db8fa2a70.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
