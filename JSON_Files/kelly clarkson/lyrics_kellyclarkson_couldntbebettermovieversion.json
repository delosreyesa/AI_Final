Am I right? Babo\nIt just couldn't taste better\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Blake Shelton]\nAnd soon, you-know-what is coming\nBut until it arrives, might as well keep the party humming, yeehaw\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, it's a square peg life in a round hole town\nBut the folks couldn't be any sweeter (Sweeter)\nIt may be upside backwards and wrong side down\nBut it just couldn't feel more completer\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd there's so much to do\nAnd it's all such bliss\nThere's no reason to fret\nWhat could ever be better than this?\nNo, it couldn't get better than\n\n[Verse 3: Pitbull]\nStop the press, ugly dog is here\nStory of the day, of the month, of the year\nHere's a little scoop on the way down low\nCheck-check-check out the flow\nThe cats are rapping, lobster snapping\nBut only the dog makes the party happen\nSo put in your paper, seal it with a kiss\nIt couldn't bet better than this\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother madhouse night in a crazy quilt world\nAnd our hearts couldn't soar any higher\nWe've got our freak flags flying, completely unfurled\nAnd we just couldn't be more fire\nAnd life's a nonstop blast, it's utter awesomeness\nYeah, it's crazy, you bet, but it couldn't get better than this\nIt's crazy, you bet, it could never get better than this\nCould never be better than this\nCould it be better than this?\n\n[Outro: Kelly Clarkson]\nGuess another sun has set\nAnd another moon has smiled\nI'm still just one more doll\nStill waiting for her child\nI'm sure it's gonna happen\nJust like the story says\nThere's a new day 'round the corner\nAnd it just might be the day", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af59e1d3ccbde2460c394bc22d72ec24.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
