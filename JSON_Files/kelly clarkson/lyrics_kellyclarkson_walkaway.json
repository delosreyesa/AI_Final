(Never showed)\nI gave you everything and never asked for anything\nAnd look at me, I'm all alone (Alone)\nSo, before you start defending\nBaby, stop all your pretending\nI know you know I know\nSo what's the point in being slow?\nLet's get the show on the road today\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm looking for attention, not another question\nShould you stay or should you go?\nWell, if you don't have the answer\nWhy you still standin' here?\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nJust walk away\nJust walk away\nJust walk away\n\n[Bridge]\nI wanna love, I wanna fire\nTo feel the burn, my desires\nI want a man by my side\nNot a boy who runs and hides\nAre you gonna fight for me?\nDie for me?\nLive and breathe for me?\nDo you care for me?\n'Cause if you don't, then boy, just leave\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm looking for attention, not another question\nShould you stay or should you go?\nWell, if you don't have the answer\nWhy you still standin' here?\nHey, hey, hey, hey (Walk away)\nJust walk away\n\n[Outro]\nIf you don't have the answer (Walk away)\nJust walk (walk) away\n(Just walk away)\nThen just leave\nYeah, yeah\nWalk away\nWalk away\nWalk away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f48874bb9534f44250315cb7f4659c0d.600x554x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
