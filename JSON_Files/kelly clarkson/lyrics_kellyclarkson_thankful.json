Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I'm thankful\nFor the blessing\nAnd the lessons that I've learned with you\nBy my side\nThat I'm thankful, so thankful for the love\nThat you keep bringing in my life\nIn my life\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't you know that I'm thankful for the moment?\nWhen I'm down, you always know how to make me smile\nThankful for the joy that you're bringing into my life\n\n[Bridge]\nFor the lessons that I've learned\nFor the trouble I've known\nFor the heartache and pain that you've thrown my way\nWhen I didn't think I could go on\nBut you made me feel strong\nWith you, I am never alone\nThankful, so thankful\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I'm thankful\nFor the blessing\nAnd the lessons that I've learned with you\nBy my side\nThat I'm thankful, so thankful for the love\nThat you keep bringing in my life\nIn my life\n\n[Outro]\nWhen I'm down, you always know how to make me smile\nThankful for the joy that you're bringing into my life, in my life\nThankful, so thankful\nThankful, so thankful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c2441d2f073293dd5ce945484ec8cacf.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
