(Have you ever been?)\nHave you ever had a friend that let you down so?\nWhen the truth came out\nWere you the last to know?\nWere you left out in the cold?\n'Cause what you did was low\nWhat you did was low\nWhat you did was low\nWhat you did was low\n\n[Verse 3]\nI walk out of this darkness\nWith no sense of regret\nAnd I go with a clear conscience\nWe both know that you can\u2019t say that\nHere's to show\nFor all the time I loved you so\nSo\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you ever been low? (Have you ever been?)\nHave you ever had a friend that let you down so?\nWhen the truth came out\nWere you the last to know?\nWere you left out in the cold?\n'Cause what you did was low\nHave you ever been low? (Have you ever been?)\nHave you ever had a friend that let you down so?\nWhen the truth came out\nWere you the last to know?\nWere you left out in the cold?\n'Cause what you did was low\n\n[Outro]\nHave you ever been low? (Have you ever been?)\nHave you ever had a friend that let you down so?\n'Cause what you did was low", "image": "https://images.genius.com/746b85c65bf837b367815edfc327ff47.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
