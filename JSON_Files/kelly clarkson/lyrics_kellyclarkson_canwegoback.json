What happened to love?\nWe had it good, but it wasn't enough\nWe shouldn't let it fade all the way\nWe're over thinking this way too much\nI want you next to me, but something's gotta change\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we go back to the way we used to be?\nBack to the butterflies, staring deep in your eyes\nCan we go back to how we used to be?\nWhen living and loving was easy\nWe gotta find a way to fool reality\nCan we go back to the way we used to be?\n\n[Bridge]\nCan we go back?\nCan we go back to the way?\nCan we go back?\nCan we go back to the way we used to be?\nCan we go back?\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, I'm getting tired of the fight\nWe can't pretend that it's alright\nI'm slowly losing hope\nBaby, can we try?\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we go back to the way we used to be?\nBack to the butterflies, staring deep in your eyes\nCan we go back to how we used to be?\nWhen living and loving was easy\nWe gotta find a way to fool reality\nCan we go back?\nWe gotta find a way to fool reality\nCan we go back?\nWe gotta find a way to fool reality\nCan we go back to the way we used to be?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2888d7e6486c3a92aa1a83ec2b9d8d9d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
