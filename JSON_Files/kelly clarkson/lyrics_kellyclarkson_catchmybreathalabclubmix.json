(Breath)\nCatching my breath, breath (breath)\nCatching my breath, breath (breath)\n\n[Hook]\nWon't let them get me down, it's all so simple now\n\n[Verse 2]\nAddicted to the love I found\nHeavy heart, now a weightless cloud\nMaking time for the ones that count\nI'll spend the rest of my time\nLaughing hard with the windows down\nLeaving footprints all over town\nKeeping faith, karma comes around\nI will spend the rest of my life\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nCatching my breath, letting it go\nTurning my cheek for the sake of the show\nNow that you know, this is my life\nI won't be told what's supposed to be right\nCatching my breath, letting it go\nTurning my cheek for the sake of the show\nNow that you know, this is my life\nI won't be told what's supposed to be right\nCatching my breath, breath, breath... (breath)\nCatching my breath, breath (breath)\nCatching my breath, breath (breath)\nCatching my breath, breath, breath...\n(Breath)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7fe9cb71143ceae11499bec1ddf9e66a.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
