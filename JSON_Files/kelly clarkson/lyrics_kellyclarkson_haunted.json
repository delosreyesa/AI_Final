I need you\nDon't leave me here on my own\nSpeak to me, be near me\nI can't survive unless I know you're with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nShadows linger\nOnly to my eye\nI see you, I feel you\nDon't leave my side\nIt's not fair\nJust when I found my world\nThey took you, they broke you, they tore out your heart\n\n[Bridge]\nI miss you, you hurt me\nYou left with a smile\nMistaken, your sadness\nWas hiding inside\nNow all that's left are the pieces to find\nThe mystery you kept\nThe soul behind a guise\n(Ooh, here inside me)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you? I need you\nDon't leave me here on my own\nSpeak to me\nBe near me\nI can't survive unless I know you're with me\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy did you go?\nAll these questions run through my mind\nI wish I couldn't feel at all\nLet me be numb\nI'm starting to fall (To fall)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you? I need you\nDon't leave me here on my own\nSpeak to me\nBe near me\nI can't survive unless I know you're with me\nWhere are you? I need you\nDon't leave me here on my own\nWhere are you?\nI can't survive unless I know you're with me\n\n[Outro]\nYou were smiling\nYou were smiling\nYou were smiling", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/kelly_clarkosn_-_my_december_cover.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
