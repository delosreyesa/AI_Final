(Just be tired)\nWithout piling on all sad and scared and out of time (Oh)\nI'm wild (Wild)\nCan I just be wild? (Just be wild)\nWithout feeling like I'm failing and I'm losing my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nCan someone just hold me?\nDon't fix me, don't try to change a thing\nOh, someone just know me\n'Cause underneath, I'm broken and it's beautiful\n\n[Outro]\nI'm broken and it's beautiful\nI'm broken and it's beautiful\nI'm broken and it's beautiful\nIt's beautiful, it's beautiful (It's beautiful)\nIt's beautiful, I'm broken and it's beautiful\nIt's beautiful, it's beautiful (It's beautiful)\nIt's beautiful, I'm broken and it's beautiful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af59e1d3ccbde2460c394bc22d72ec24.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
