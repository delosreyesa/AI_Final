(no, no, no)\nDon't get crazy, keep between those lines (We love ??)\nHere's what we have in mind\nWe've worked with everyone\nTrust us and see\nWash, rinse, and repeat\n\n[Bridge]\nWash, rinse, and repeat\nWash, rinse, and repeat\n\n[Verse 2]\nHi, my name is and I'm here to run everything\nSpreading like a cancer I will die and take you all with me\nLet you have a little bit when secretly I'm waiting to rip the rug from underneath\nCan't believe you fell for it\nMusic from the past, from the present\nWell, just last week\nWe will change a note and get away with it (wait and see)\nJust when you think that we've changed\nLike an addict we sweep right back in with a dose of reality\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nWash, rinse, and repeat\nWash, rinse, and repeat\nWash, rinse, and repeat\nWash, rinse, and repeat\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe definition of insanity is repeating the same thing, over and over\nExpecting a different result\nI'm insane (I'm insane)\nJust wash, rinse, and repeat\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nWash, rinse, repeat\nYou love this song (everybody can do it)\nThis song is the most amazing song that you have ever heard (it's easy)\n(Anybody can do it, and I mean anybody)\nThis song is completely different from that other song, that sounds exactly the same!\n\n[Outro]\nYes it is\nYes it is\nYes it is\nYes it is", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c5662e7b745598a397152e1ca78dcd0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kelly Clarkson"}
