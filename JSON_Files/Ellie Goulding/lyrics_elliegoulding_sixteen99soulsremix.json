(All the good time)\nWhen we were sixteen\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLike we were sixteen\nLike we were sixteen\nWe were sixteen, we were sixteen\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you remember the teacher said\n\"You're too young, too stupid, don't lose your head\"\nBut years gone and we held on with the best intent\nJust two kids who kicked it on MSN\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, time\nSuddenly, we got no time\nWe're so busy doing life\nThat I miss your eyes on mine, mine\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, if you just focus on me\nLike we were sixteen\nAnd planning our lives (When we were planning our lives)\nCan I wear your t-shirt\nAnd sleep on you\nWhile I dream of all the good times? (All the good times)\nWhen we were sixteen\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLike we were sixteen\nLike we were sixteen\nLike we were sixteen\nLike we were sixteen\n\n[bridge]\nThey said we'd never even make it, make it this far\nBut here we are\nAnd we're still counting stars\nLike we were sixteen\nThey said we'd never even make it this far\nBut here we are\nAnd we're still counting stars\nLike we were sixteen\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, if you just focus on me\nLike we were sixteen\nAnd planning our lives (When we were planning our lives)\nCan I wear your t-shirt\nAnd sleep on you\nWhile I dream of all the good times? (All the good times)\nWhen we were sixteen\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLike we were sixteen\nLike we were sixteen\nLike we were sixteen", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b4cd2ceb9ab92f178cc5566e00bd8bb3.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Ellie Goulding"}
