I'm searchin', but I'm terrified\nThat by the time I find what I'm lookin' for, I'll be dead inside\n\n[Outro: Angel Haze (Ellie Goulding)]\nCause part time love is the life round here\nWe're never done\n(We're never done)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ddb85fbf21ba69e18851b58efe4ac77.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ellie Goulding"}
