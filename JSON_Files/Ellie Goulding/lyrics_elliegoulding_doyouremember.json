(Oh no)\nDo you remember when we used to hide? (Oh no)\nDo you remember we were so alive? (Oh no)\nDo you remember? We were so damn wrong, it was right (Oh no)\nDo you remember?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe would fight 'til the death just for fun (Oh no)\nPretend you would lose so I think I've won\nYeah, we could be anyone\n\n[Pre-Chours]\nYou were my protection\nWill you be there for me now?\nI know we had our problems\nBut we always come back around\n'Cause you're always my reflection\nWill I see you in the crowd?\nYou were my protection\nNow I hold my ground\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember when I gave you life? (Oh no)\nDo you remember when we used to hide? (Oh no)\nDo you remember we were so alive? (Oh no)\nDo you remember? We were so damn wrong, it was right (Oh no)\nDo you remember?\n\n[Bridge]\nI still remember when you gave me life\nI still remember when we used to hide\nBut our time together was the time of my life\nYeah, our time together was the time of my life (Ooh)\n(Oh no, oh no, oh no)\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember?\nDo you remember when I gave you life?\n(When I gave you life, oh no)\nDo you remember when we used to hide?\n(Oh, when we used to hide, oh no)\nDo you remember we were so alive?
