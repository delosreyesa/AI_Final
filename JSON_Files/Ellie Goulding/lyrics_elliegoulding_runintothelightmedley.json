we to turn each others heads?\nWho are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?\nI don't like the way I never listen to myself\nI feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help\n\nI don't think you know me much at all\n\nThis love is be and end all\nThis love will be your downfall\nI'm feeling down about this love\n\nWho are you to make me feel so good?\nWho are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood?\nOh who am I to say I'm always yours\nWho am I to choose the boy that everyone adores\nI don't see a reason why we can't just be apart\nNow we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark\n\nI don't think you warned me much at all\n\nThis love is be and end all\nThis love will be your downfall\n\nThis love is not what you want\nThis heart will never be yours\nThis love is be and end all\nThis love will be your downfall\n\nThis love is be and end all\nThis love will be your downfall\n\nYou're so quiet\nBut it doesn't faze me\nYou're on time\nYou move so fast\nMakes me feel lazy\n\nAnd let's join forces\nWe've got our guns and horses\nI know you've been burnt\nBut every fire is a lesson learnt\n\nI left my house\nLeft my clothes\nDoor wide open\nHeaven knows\nYou're so worth it, you are\n\nBut I wish I could feel it all for you\nI wish I could be it all for you\nIf I could erase the pain\nAnd maybe you'd feel the same\nI'd do it all for you\nI would, I would, I would, I would, I would\n\nLet\u2019s tie words\n'Cause they amount to nothing\nPlay it down\nPretend you can't take what you've found\nBut you found me\nOn a screen you sit at permanently\n\nI left my house\nLeft my clothes\nDoor wide open\nHeaven knows\nYou're so worth it, you are\n\nBut I wish I could feel it all for you\nI wish I could be it all for you\nIf I could erase the pain\nAnd maybe you'd feel the same\nI'd do it all for you\nI would, I would, I would, I would\n\nIt's time to come clean and make sense of everything\nIt's time that we found out who we are\n'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark\nI see your face in every star\n\nBut I wish I could feel it all for you\nI wish I could be it all for you\nIf I could erase the pain\nAnd maybe you'd feel the same\nI'd do it all for you\nI would, I would, I would, I would, I would\n\nI'd do it all for you, I would\nI'd do it all for you, I would\nI'd do it all for you, I would\nI'd do it all for you, I would\nI'd do it all for you\n\nI had a way then\nLosing it all on my own\nI had a heart then\nBut the queen has been overthrown\nAnd I'm not sleeping now\nThe dark is too hard to beat\nAnd I'm not keeping up\nThe strength I need to push me\n\nYou show the lights that stop me turn to stone\nYou shine them when I'm alone\nAnd so I tell myself that I'll be strong\nAnd dreaming when they're gone\nCuz they're calling, calling, calling me home\nCalling, calling, calling home\nYou show the lights that stop me turn to stone\nYou shine them when I'm alone\n\nNoises, I play within my head\nTouch my own skin\nAnd hope they'll still be there\nAnd I think back to when\nMy brother and my sister slept\nIn another place\nThe only time I feel safe\n\nYou show the lights that stop me turn to stone\nYou shine them when I'm alone\nAnd so I tell myself that I'll be strong\nAnd dreaming when they're gone\nCuz they're calling, calling, calling me home\nCalling, calling, calling home\nYou show the lights that stop me turn to stone\nYou shine them when I'm alone\n\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\nLights, lights\n\nYou show the lights that stop me turn to stone\nYou shine them when I'm alone\nAnd so I tell myself that I'll be strong\nAnd dreaming when they're gone\nCuz they're calling, calling, calling me home\nCalling, calling, calling home\nYou show the lights that stop me turn to stone\nYou shine them when I'm alone\n\nHome, home\n(Lights, lights, lights)...\n\nYou're as sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove\nThat is no way to live that is no way to love\nFull of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in\n\nStabbed in the back but you feel no pain\nPush the heaviest doors that you can't open\nYeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again\n\nYou're as bright as the sun and as bold as the moon\nI don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon\nIf my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you\n\nI've got the salt skin\nRunning to where he is\nNever going to give in\nEven with the strength\n\nHe's stealing salt skin\nTelling me I'm winning wars they\nCreated just to understand\n\"The meaning of\"\n\nHands on strings and my mouth open\nFind the perfect words that I've not spoken\nAnd I won't tell the truth unless you want me to\n\nFor all of the times that I lost my head\nWhen it rolled to the floor and I found it again\nBut when it came back\nI didn't know my own name\n\nI've got the salt skin\nRunning to where he is\nNever going to give in\nEven with the strength\n\nHe's stealing salt skin\nTelling me I'm winning wars they\nCreated just to understand\n\"The meaning of\"\n\nI've got the salt skin\nRunning to where he is\nNever going to give in\nEven with the strength\n\nHe's stealing salt skin\nTelling me I'm winning wars they\nCreated just to understand\n\nI've got the salt skin\nRunning to where he is\nNever going to give in\nEven with the strength\n\nHe's stealing salt skin\nTelling me I'm winning wars they\nCreated just to understand...\n\"the meaning of\"\n\nOh, oh, starry eyed\nHit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning\n\nHandle bars\nThat I let go, let go\nFor anyone\nTake me in\nAnd I'll throw out my heart\nAnd get a new one\n\nNext thing, we're touching\nYou look at me it's like you hit me with lightning\n\nOh\nEverybody's starry eyed\nAnd everybody glows\nOh\nEverybody's starry eyed\nAnd my body goes\n\nSo we burst\nInto colours\nColours\nAnd carousels\nFall head first\nLike paper planes and playground games\n\nNext thing, we're touching\nYou look at me it's like you hit me with lightning\n\nOh\nEverybody's starry eyed\nAnd everybody glows\nOh\nEverybody's starry eyed\nAnd my body goes\n\nNext thing, we're touching\nNext thing, we're touching\n(We come and we go)\nNext thing,

out\nHer clothes were never off\nWe still have hours to run about\nTo scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track\nI've seen you in a fight you lost, I\u2019ve seen you in a
