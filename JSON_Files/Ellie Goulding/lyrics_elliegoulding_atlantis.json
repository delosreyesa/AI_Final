Where did you go? Where did you go?\nWhere did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?\nGo? Where did you go? Where did you go?\nWhere did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm exhausted with loving\nNo fight in me; I'm defeated\nI know I'm fooled, I can't help it\nYou make my heart so helpless\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'll forget you not\nI'll forget you not\nI'll look for you, for you maybe\nI'll forget you not... I'll forget you not\nI'll look for you maybe\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?\nWhere did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?\nGo? Where did you go?
