(hu-u-uman)\nI would give my life. (hu~u~uman)\nI would give my life. (hu-u-uman)\n\n[Chorus]\nI would give my life to be human\nI would give my life to be human\nI would give my life to be human\nI would give my life to be human...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/815d2424d6a8c824eb2bcc3572fc4639.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ellie Goulding"}
