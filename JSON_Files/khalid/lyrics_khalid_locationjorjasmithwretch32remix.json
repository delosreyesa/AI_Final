I follow through\n\n[Chorus: Wretch 32]\nSo send me your location\n'Cause I want your vibrations and frequencies\nOnly trees and seeds\n\n[Outro: Khalid]\nI don't need nothing else but you\nNothing else but you\nDo, do, do, do, do, do\nOh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nDo, do, do, do, do, do, do\nI don't need nothing else but you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68aa61ef59132e8911176e7e58ceb88d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Khalid"}
