Hmm\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been so used to winnin'\nIt was hard for me to lose\nNo, there's nothing wrong with me\nThere's just something wrong with you\nSo I've been making changes\nBeen workin' on my health\nNo more competition\nCan't compete against myself, no, no, no\nI'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no\nI've been doin' this to be remembered\nLet the people hear it if they want to\nHelp the one's around me get it on, too\nIf I die tomorrow and I'm gone\nLet the blood run high\nLet the carpets drown\nI'll be forever now\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\nNow, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\nI don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\nNow, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\n[Outro]\nLet this be a promise\nThat when it's said and done\nBe a flower in the garden\nBe one with the sun\nBe one with the sun\nBe one with the sun\nBe one with the sun\nBe one with the sun", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8a43c3031364d3bb34c3ae7b76ceb5d7.606x606x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Khalid"}
