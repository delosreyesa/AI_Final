Are you feeling me?\nTo be honest\nI'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool\nWith your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before\nAnd if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah\nWe've been talking for a minute now\nLet me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah\nYou put me on your super high\nI want to get lost in your paradise\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)\nThere's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nYou give me a reason to want you (Want you)\nYou give me a reason (Yeah, yeah, ooh)\nGive me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nGive me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, reason, yeah)\n\n[Verse 3]\nLucid dream, in reality\nI'm just tryna feel your gravity\nAlways fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle\nWe don't even need a title\nYou're always on my mind\nIt's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time\nYou don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night\nI don't know what this is but it feels just right\nI wanna make a move\nLet me know if that sounds cool, yeah\nAll the things I'd do\nAll the things I'd do for you\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)\nThere's millions of reasons (There's millions of reasons, ooh)\nYou give me a reason to want you (Want you)\nYou give me a reason (Reason, ooh, ooh)\nGive me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Give me a reason)\nGive me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (You give me a reason)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ae28de05b09238bf3dc629aacce3c24b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Khalid"}
