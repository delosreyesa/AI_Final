'Cause I am\nI got so high the other night\nSwear to God, felt my feet lift the ground, ooh, yeah\nYour back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about\nMy ears\n\n[Chorus]\n(Nothing feels better than this\nNothing feels better\nNothing feels better than this\nNothing feels better, oh no\nWe don't gotta hide, this is what you like\nI admit, nothing feels better than this)\n\nNothing feels better than this\nNothing feels better\nNothing feels better than this\nNothing feels better, oh no\nWe don't gotta hide, this is what you like\nI admit, nothing feels better than this\n\nNothing feels better than this\nNothing feels better\nNothing feels better than this\nNothing feels better, oh no\nWe don't gotta hide, this is what you like\nI admit, nothing feels better than this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/937e98389be2974fb5ac5ce3fe07c6c6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Khalid"}
