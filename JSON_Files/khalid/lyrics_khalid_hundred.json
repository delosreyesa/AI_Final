Are you scared?\nPeople keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be\nWalking down the line, but they don\u2019t live what they preach (Live what they preach)\nSharing attributes with all our own enemies\nYou gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up)\nI'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today\n(Yeah, and I won't be waiting on you)\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up, no no)\nI'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nYou gotta take it slow (Alright)\nDust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control (Yeah, mmm)\nGotta take it slow\nDust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control\n(Dust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control)\nYou gotta take it slow (Oh)\nDust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control\n(Dust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control)\nGotta take it slow\nDust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control\n(Dust yourself off, don\u2019t you lose control)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n\n[Outro]\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\nHundred days and I'm still alive\nHundred days and I'm still alive\nIts been a hundred, mmm\nHundred, hundred days and I'm still alive\nHad a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don\u2019t need em\nNot like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing\nSummer's over so they switching around like the seasons\nGotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense\nEverybody wants a favor, everybody needs me\nBut I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons\nI'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons\nEverybody wants a favor, everybody needs me\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\nHundred days and I'm still alive\nHundred days and I'm still alive\nIts been a hundred, mmm\nHundred, hundred days and I'm still alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a1095650e03dec89017682d0b304ac11.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Khalid"}
