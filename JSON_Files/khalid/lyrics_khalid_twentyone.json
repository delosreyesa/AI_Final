Yeah\nSo lay with me, lay with me, we're underneath the bleachers\nStay or leave, stay or leave, I hope you're never leaving\nAll of these memories crawling underneath your skin, skin (Oh, oh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?\nAll our lives, it never ends\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, alright\nYou gotta hold on tight\nYeah, alright, alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't believe everything\nThe shit you like gives you anxiety, but finally\nI see you smiling when you say you need privacy\nYou're only hiding from yourself, mmm, oh\nI say I'm fine, coming home\nI see the sun come up and shut the blinds\nEpisodes, I know I never take my own advice when I'm wrong\nBut I can't do it by myself, oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?\nAll our lives, it never ends\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, alright (Alright)\nYou gotta hold on tight\nYeah, alright\nYou gotta hold on tight\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause I'm in pain, but I'm to blame\nTo end this fight, I have to change\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, alright\nHold on tight\nYeah, alright\nHold on tight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a1095650e03dec89017682d0b304ac11.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Khalid"}
