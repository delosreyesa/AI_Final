Typo said I loved ya\nDidn't mean what I was sayin'\nNo, I wasn't playin', just confused\nWas tryna play it smooth\nStood spinnin' in this room\nIn this state I been consumed\nState I been consumed\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya\n'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is\nIf you wanna, let me know where you are, then\nI can come and love (I can come and love)\nI can come and love (I can come and love ya)\nI can come and love ya (I can come and love)\nI can come and love ya (I can come and love ya)\n\n[Bridge]\nI know it's taking all your strength to keep restrained\n'Cause you got different things replacing\nOld feelings that you felt\nNow you seen it for yourself\nWhere's the shame? No shame in what you need\n\n[Chorus]\nFucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya\n'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is\nIf you wanna, let me know where you are, then\nI can come and love (I can come and love)\nI can come and love (I can come and love ya)\nI can come and love ya (I can come and love)\nI can come and love ya (I can come and love ya)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/906da1ec9901ff2e2c133ec6d025c85f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
