Tell 'em don't waste my time, I'm the cleanest\nI don't need a Snapchat to prove I have a life\nWho gives a fuck about a dress when there's death in Palestine?\nNo pretty gold or blue, it's just black and it's white\nAnd it proves dependent on reflection of light\nYour perception becomes deception for the mind\nThat's why I judge no colour, creed or size (Drink, Lucas!)\nI'll fuck any girl 'cause I ain't got a type\nFuck every girl 'cause I ain't got a type\nYou just on the hype, you shit on the mic\nWhen I'm on the mic, I still pedal by on a pedal bike\nNever slow down, never sell mine\nYou be set alight, tell me when I've ever said a lie\nWill they ever understand what happens in this state of mind?\nDamn, man, newcomer fuckin' with your own girl\nOh well, they don't know I plan to fuck the whole world\nWhole world, ZAYN's payin' for the whole hotel\nAnd wholesale L-O-L, like \"lol\", bro\nOnly check the price at the till though, YOLO\nIs you trill though? Little dildo\nWhat's the deal though? Got an album comin' with no deal though\nDo what you can, I'll do what I will, bro\nI'll fuck any girl that isn't on the pill, yo\n\n[Chorus: ZAYN & Mic Righteous]\nI ain't got no type\nBad bitches is the only thing that I like\nYou ain't got no life\nCups with the ice, yeah, we do this every night\nI ain't check the price\nI make my own money, so I spend it how I like\nI'm just livin' life\nAnd let my mama tell me, yeah, I ain't livin' right\n\n[Post-Chorus: ZAYN]\nLet my mama tell me, yeah\nYeah let my mama tell me, yeah\nLet my mama tell me, yeah\nYeah let my mama tell me, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb7c149e616835cc1a990807ae5c23f8.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
