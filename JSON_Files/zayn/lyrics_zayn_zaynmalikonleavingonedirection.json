But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6818a27a849fdbc099f7a39d5a819727.810x810x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
