If I pull it together\nMake it sooner than later, we won't be here forever\nAnd I realized I waited too long but please don't move on\nYou don't need no one else, you don't need no one else\nYou don't need no one else, you don't need no one else\nYou don't need no one else", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13d5a4c562d3bd47337f9db6a7397b24.480x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
