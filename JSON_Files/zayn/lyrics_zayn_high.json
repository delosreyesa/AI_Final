Who should I call?\"\nI do not profess a political manner\nBut Oprah does, and I still stan her\nI'm a poet, I speak my mind\nTake what you will and comprehend it\nA thought just popped in the middle of this sentence\nif time just stopped, then we'd never see the ending\nI guess that's the beauty of every creator given life\nWe see and feel the miracle around us all the time\nWe breathe and just the oxygen is enough to get you high", "image": "https://images.genius.com/24f4b23ebc77baef51eb477d5b3edbe3.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
