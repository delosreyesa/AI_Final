Just us\n\n[Verse 4]\nOkay, got this OJ and Jose\nMixed it up with that Rose\nWe gon' do this our own way\nAlright, okay\nWhat is it that you're smoking?\nPiece it up with this peace and love\nAnd this peace and love like the old days\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat I am trying to say is\nThat love is ours to make so we should make it\nEverything else can wait\nThe time is ours to take so we should take it\n\n[Outro]\nStay right here with ya\nLay right here with ya\n'Cause everything is okay right here\nYou should stay right here\nWe should lay right here, oh\n'Cause everything is okay right here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d3acd415bd7ea9c30f77f0bbbd6ca7f.589x589x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
