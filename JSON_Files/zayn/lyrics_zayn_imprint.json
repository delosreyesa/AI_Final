I need ya\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can take it all off\n'Cause this love ain't got no cost\nNo excuses I'll be cursed for you\nIt's just something that I say to you\nIf you want it I can change\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGirl we'd still make it\nIf the planets all faded away\nYou might think I'm crazy\nBut I know you're my baby anyway\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you took two minutes out of my life\nYeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\n\n[Verse 3]\nI never told you the story, oh\nThey say this building's from Victorian times\nI guess we all got a story, oh\nJust tellin' mine\nChange the scenario\nJumpin' like Mario\nGotta give it all a go\nDon't lose a life\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you took two minutes out of my life\nYeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\nGirl you took two minutes out of my life\nYeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed\nI don't want 'em back\nI just want you back in my bed", "image": "https://images.genius.com/457eb1df035f38f1e6886f9ea37b6f64.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
