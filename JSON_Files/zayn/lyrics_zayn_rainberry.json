Ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nRainberry\nFalling down your blood-red lips\nWhy are your eyes heavy?\nIs there somebody else you missed?\nTell me what's going on before I go too far\nSaid, Rainberry\nIs there somebody else, somebody else now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDry your eyes 'cause it won't work this time\nI already dried mine, and I won't drown in yours\nGo wash your hands, but you can't change your past\nThose stories ain't shit now\nYou don't mean it, I'm sure\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nToo many bones inside your closet\nYou thought you buried deep\nBut they never let me get a minute of peace\nHow do you sleep? Ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nRainberry\nFalling down your blood-red lips\nWhy are your eyes heavy?\nIs there somebody else you missed?\nTell me what's going on before I go too far\nSaid, Rainberry\nIs there somebody else, somebody else now?\n\n[Bridge]\nRainberry, please\nRainberry\nRainberry, please\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nToo many bones inside your closet\nYou thought you buried deep\nBut they never let me get a minute of peace\nHow do you sleep? Ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nRainberry\nFalling down your blood-red lips\nWhy are your eyes heavy?\nIs there somebody else you missed?\nTell me what's going on before I go too far\nSaid, Rainberry\nIs there somebody else, somebody else now?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b7276781b1e1b8cac04fcf0f4023b2db.542x528x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ZAYN"}
