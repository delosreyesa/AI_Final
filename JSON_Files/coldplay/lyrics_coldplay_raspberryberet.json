(She wouldn't wear much more)\nYeah (Raspberry beret)\n\nI think I... I think I... I think I love her\n\n(Raspberry beret)\nNo no no\nNo no no (The kind you find)\n(In a second hand store)\n(Raspberry beret)\n\nTell me\nWhere have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)\n(Wouldn't wear much more)\n(Raspberry beret)\nI think I love...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11f6b79103524330b663f6c08030963f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
