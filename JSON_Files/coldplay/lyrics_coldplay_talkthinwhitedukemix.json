Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...\n\nYou could take a picture of something you see\nIn the future where will I be?\nYou can climb a ladder up to the sun\nOr write a song nobody had sung\nOr do something that's never been done\n\nComputer voice: Now talk baby!\nComputer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...\n\nAre you lost or incomplete\nDo you feel like a puzzle\nYou can't find your missing piece\nTell me how you feel\nHow you feel\nHow you feel\nHow you feel\n\nSo you take a picture of something you see\nIn the future where will I be\nYou could climb a ladder up to the sun\nOr write a song nobody had sung, or do\nSomething that's never been done\n\nComputer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...\n\nComputer voice: Now talk baby!\n\nHow you feel\nHow you feel (how you feel)\nHow you feel...\nLet's talk, let's talk\nLet's talk, let's talk\nLet's talk, let's talk...\n\nSo you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk\nYou'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored\nWhen you worry about the future or the third world war\nAnd you feel like you're going where you've been before\nLet's talk, let's talk\nLet's talk, let's talk\nLet's talk, let's talk...\n\nComputer chant: Talk to me...
