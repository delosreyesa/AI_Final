How come people part?\nHow come people struggle? How come people break your heart?\nBreak your heart?\nYes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel\nYes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up\nHeal it up\nSee the forest there in every seed\nAngels in the marble waiting to be freed\nJust need love, Just need love\nWhen the going is rough, saying\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together right now\nGonna get it, get it together somehow\nGonna get it, get it together and flower\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together I know\nGonna get it, get it together and flow\nGonna get it, get it together and go\n\n[Bridge: Chris Martin]\nAnd you can say what is, or fight for it\nClose your mind or take a risk\nYou can say it\u2019s mine and clench your fist\nOr see each sunrise as a gift\n\n[Guitar Solo 1: Jonny Buckland]\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together right now\nGonna get it, get it together somehow\nGonna get it, get it together and flower\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together I know\nGonna get it, get it together and flow\nGonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together right now\nGonna get it, get it together somehow\nGonna get it, get it together and flower\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together I know\nGonna get it, get it together and flow\nGonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and up\n\n[Guitar Solo 2: Noel Gallagher]\n\n[Interlude: Chris Martin]\nOh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, whoa, oh\nOh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, whoa, oh\n\n[Outro: Chris Martin]\nFixing up a car to drive in it again\nWhen you\u2019re in pain, when you think you\u2019ve had enough\nDon\u2019t ever give up\nDon't ever give up\n\n[Coda: Annabelle Wallis]\nBelieve in love...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11c8d5aae2436a80070cb7ca4dbe4da6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
