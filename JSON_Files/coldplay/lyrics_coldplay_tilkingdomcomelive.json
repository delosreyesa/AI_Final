'til Kingdom Come\nUntil my day... my day is done\nAnd say you'll come... and set me free\nJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for me\n\nIn your tears... and in your blood\nIn your fire... and in your flood\nI hear you laugh... I heard you sing\nI wouldn't change a single thing\n\nAnd the wheels just keep on turning\nThe drummers begin to drum\nI don't know which way I'm going\nI don't know what I've become\n\nFor you I'd wait... 'til kingdom come\nUntil my days... my days are done\nSay you'll come... and set me free\nJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for me\n\nJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for me\nJust say you'll wait... you'll wait for me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11f6b79103524330b663f6c08030963f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
