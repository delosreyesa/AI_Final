What if they say \"Get out of here, kid. You got no future?\u201d\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]\nNow you could run and just say they\u2019re right\nNo, I\u2019ll never be no one in my whole life\nOr you could turn and say, \"No, wait, they're wrong\"\nAnd get to keep on dancing all life long\n\n[Verse 2: Chris Martin]\nMy father said never give up son\nJust look what Amelia and Joan done\nOh Rosa, Teresa their war won\nNot scared to be strong\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]\nNow you could run and just say they\u2019re right\nNo I\u2019ll never be no one in my whole life\nOr you could turn and say no wait, they\u2019re wrong\nAnd get to keep on dancing all life long\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nYeah you could be someone special\nYou've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins\nYou'll go higher than they've ever gone\nIn you I see someone special\nYou've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone\nJust turn it on\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nLook I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition\nMy funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison\nUntil I realized I had to set my mind free\nI was trusting statistics more than I trust me\nGet a degree, good job, 401k, but I\u2019m trying to turn k\u2019s to m\u2019, what does it take?\nAnd maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly\nInstead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to\nI guess you either watch the show or you show and prove\nProve it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself\nNever complacent till we hit the oasis\nOne life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah\nWe on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nYeah you could be someone special\nYou've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone\nIn you I see someone special\nYou've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone\nJust turn it on\n\n[Outro: Chris Martin]\nIn you I see someone special\nDon't go to war with yourself\nJust turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbc062abbb5b1ebba266337108897474.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
