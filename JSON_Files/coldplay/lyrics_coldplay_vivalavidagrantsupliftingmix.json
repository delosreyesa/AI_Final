Long live the king!\"\n\nOne minute I held the key\nNext the walls were closed on me\nAnd I discovered that my castles stand\nUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nOnce you go there was never\nNever an honest word\nAnd that was when I ruled the world\n\nIt was the wicked and wild wind\nBlew down the doors to let me in\nShattered windows and the sound of drums\nPeople couldn't believe what I'd become\n\nRevolutionaries wait\nFor my head on a silver plate\nJust a puppet on a lonely string\nOh who would ever want to be king?\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Peter won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\nRoman cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my mirror, my sword and shield\nMy missionaries in a foreign field\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Peter won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11f6b79103524330b663f6c08030963f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
