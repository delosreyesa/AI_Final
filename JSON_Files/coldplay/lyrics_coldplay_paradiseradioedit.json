(x2)\nLa, la, la...\nAnd so lying underneath those stormy skies\nShe'd say, \"oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise\"\nThis could be\nPara-para-paradise\nPara-para-paradise\nPara-para-paradise\nOh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh\nThis could be\nPara-para-paradise\nPara-para-paradise\nThis could be\nPara-para-paradise\nOh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh\nThis could be\nPara-para-paradise\nPara-para-paradise\nThis could be\nPara-para-paradise\nOh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh\nOoooh...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11f6b79103524330b663f6c08030963f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
