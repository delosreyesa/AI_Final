You just cry\n\n[Verse 2]\nPoor me, so blind I couldn't see\nThe forest for the trees, I don't know why\n\nPoor you, you split yourself in two\nNow what you gonna do? You just cry\n\n[Chorus]\nI hear you come nearer\nI hear you but I don't understand\nI hear you come nearer\nI hear you but I don't understand\n\n[Verse 3]\nPoor me, floatin' out to sea\nAn opportunity that went by\n\nPoor you, now what you gonna do?\nWhat you gonna do? You just cry\n\n[Chorus]\nI hear you come nearer\nI hear you but I don't understand\nI hear you come nearer\nI hear you but I don't understand\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't understand\nI don't understand\nWoooh...\n\n???, I'm gonna feel it now\nI'm gonna feel it now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5b53fe0b21b6c64612152c45f9516df4.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
