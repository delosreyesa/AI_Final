I feel fine\nI'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life\nI'm alright, I feel good\nSo I'll go, and I'll try to stop moving\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep\nBut I've got to get going, so much that I'm wanting to do\nBut I wake up smiling\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd this could be my last chance\nOf saving my innocence\nAnd this could be my last chance\nNo more keeping my feet on the ground\n\n[Verse 4]\nSometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising\nSurprisingly good to be moving around\nAnd I move\nI wake up smiling\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo what?
