That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. The kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure!\nA wonderful adventure!\n\n[Verse 1]\nOh, I think I landed\nIn a world I hadn't seen\nWhen I'm feeling ordinary\nWhen I don't know what I mean\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, I think I landed\nWhere there are miracles at work\nFor the thirst and for the hunger\nCome the conference of birds\n\n[Chorus]\nSaying it's true, it's not what it seems\nLeave your broken windows open\nAnd in the light just streams\nYou get a head, a head full of dreams\nYou can see the change you wanted\nBe what you want to be\nAnd you get a head, a head full of dreams\nInto life, I\u2019ve just been woken\nWith a head full, a head full of dreams\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, I think I landed\nWhere there are miracles at work\nNow you've got me open-handed\nNow you've got me lost for words\nI sing oh, whoa, oh, oh\nI sing oh, whoa, oh, oh\nOh, whoa, oh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nFull of dreams (Oh, whoa, oh, oh)\nInto life, I\u2019ve just been spoken\nWith a head full, a head full of dreams", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d206c57f7c61d2a7ac9ea1f177a1d1c7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
