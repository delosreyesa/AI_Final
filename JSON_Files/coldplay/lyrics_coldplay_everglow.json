How come cars don\u2019t slow?\nWhen it feels like the end of my world\nWhen I should, but I can\u2019t let you go\n\n[Chorus 1]\nBut when I\u2019m cold, cold\nWhen I\u2019m cold, cold\nThere\u2019s a light that you give me when I\u2019m in shadow\nThere\u2019s a feeling within me, everglow\n\n[Verse 3]\nLike brothers in blood, sisters who ride\nAnd we swore on that night, we\u2019d be friends 'til we die\nBut the changing of winds, and the way waters flow\nLife is short as the falling of snow\nAnd now, I\u2019m gonna miss you, I know\n\n[Chorus 2]\nBut when I\u2019m cold, cold\nIn water rolled, salt\nAnd I know that you\u2019re with me and the way you will show\nAnd you\u2019re with me wherever I go\nAnd you give me this feeling, this everglow\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold\nBecause I live for this feeling, this everglow\n\n[Outro]\nSo if you love someone, you should let them know\nOh, the light that you left me will everglow", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5881c376782cabdb1de2b38d38415fb8.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
