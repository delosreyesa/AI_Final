How come people part?\nHow come people struggle? How come people break your heart?\nBreak your heart?\nYes, I wanna know, show me how to feel\nYes, I wanna grow, show me how to heal it up\nHeal it up\nSee the forest there in every seed\nAngels in the marble waiting to be freed\nJust need love, just need love\nWhen the going is rough, say\n\n[Chorus]\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together right now\nGonna get it, get it together somehow\nGonna get it, get it together and flower\nOh, ah\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together, I know\nGonna get it, get it together and flow\nGonna get it, get it together and go up\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd you can say what is, or fight for it\nClose your mind or take a risk\nYou can say it\u2019s mine and clench your fist\nOr see each sunrise as a gift\n\n[Chorus]\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together right now\nGonna get it, get it together somehow\nGonna get it, get it together and flower\nOh, ah\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together, I know\nGonna get it, get it together and flow\nGonna get it, get it together and go up\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together right now\nGonna get it, get it together somehow\nGonna get it, get it together and flower\nOh, ah\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together, I know\nGonna get it, get it together and flow\nGonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and up\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, oh\nOh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nFixing up a car to drive in it again\nWhen you\u2019re in pain, when you think you\u2019ve had enough\nDon\u2019t ever give up\nDon't ever give up\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nOur friends, this is the end of A Head Full of Dreams Tour\nBack where it all began, Buenos Aires\nThank you, everybody all around the world, at home and abroad\nFor being the best part of our show, for being the music\nAnd for keeping your and our heads full of dreams\nThis was our first chapter\nFrom now on, we'll only be full of surprises\nWe love you, we're grateful for all of you with all of our hearts\nWe exist for and because of you\nGood night, good afternoon, good morning, wherever you are in the world\nGod bless you all, be kind to each other\nWe're in this together, we're one big band\nEverything is possible if you never give up\nAnd if you believe in love\nBelieve in, in love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d206c57f7c61d2a7ac9ea1f177a1d1c7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
