How come people part?\nHow come people struggle? How come people\nBreak your heart? Break your heart?\n\nYes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel\nYes I wanna know, show me how to\nHeal it up, heal it up\n\nSee the forest there in every seed\nAngels in the marble waiting to be freed\nJust need love, Just need love\nWhen the going is rough, saying\n\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together\nI know we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehow\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and flower\n\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together\nI know, we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and float\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and up\n\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together\nI know we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together somehow\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and flower\n\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together\nI know, we\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and float\nWe\u2019re gonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43784b815b0d51ba1ee9aaf8e0b4d9dc.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
