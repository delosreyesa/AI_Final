Singing\n\nYou are\nYou are\nYou are\nYou are\n\nYou are\nYou are\n\nAnd nothing else compares\nOh, nothing else compares\nAnd nothing else compares\n\nYou are\nYou are\n\nHome, home, where I wanted to go\nHome, home, where I wanted to go\nHome, home, where I wanted to go (You are)\nHome, home, where I wanted to go (You are)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/00d2b38a9ccb86b49728b1f22c92d96a.760x760x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
