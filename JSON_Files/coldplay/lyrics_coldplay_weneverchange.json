No, no\nWe never learn, do we?\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I wanna live in a wooden house\nWhere making more friends would be easy\nOh, and I don't have a soul to save\nYes, and I sin every single day\n\n[Chorus]\nWe never change, do we?\nWe never learn, do we?\n\n[Outro]\nSo I wanna live in a wooden house\nWhere making more friends would be easy\nI wanna live where the sun comes out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5d0637ce9755fbda95875edc7a62d4cc.772x767x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
