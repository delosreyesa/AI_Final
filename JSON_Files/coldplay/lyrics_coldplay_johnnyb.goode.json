Goode...\nWho never ever learned to read or write so well\nBut he could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell\n\nGo Go\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nJohnny B. Goode\n\nHe use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack\nGo sit beneath the tree by the railroad track\nOh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shade\nStrummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made\nPeople passing by, they would stop and say\nOh my but that little country boy could play\n\nGo Go\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nGo Johnny Go\nGo\nJohnny B. Goode\n\nHis mother told him, \"Someday you will be a man\nAnd you will be the leader of a big old band\nMany people comin' from miles around\nTo hear you play your music when the sun go down\nMaybe someday your name will be in lights\nSayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight.\"\n\nGo Go\nGo Johnny Go\nGo Go Go\nJohnny Go\nOh Go go\nJohnny Go\nOh Go Go\nJohnny Go\nGo\nJohnny B.
