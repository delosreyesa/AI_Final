Singing\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are\nYou are\nYou, you are\nYou are\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, nothing else compares\nOh, nothing else compares\nOh, nothing else compares\nNo, no\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are\nYou are\n\n[Outro]\nHome, home\nWhere I wanted to go\nHome, home\nWhere I wanted to go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d206c57f7c61d2a7ac9ea1f177a1d1c7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coldplay"}
