Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I\u2019d rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it?\n\nWell\u2026 No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. (Did I mention that I\u2019m having fun with this?? Ha!)\n*Makes a serious face*\n\nSo, here goes:\n\nThis year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the \u201cgrapevine,\u201d I\u2019m gearing up for a big 2013\nBack in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC\nThe inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn\u2019t expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I\u2019ve had in my career\u2026\n\nJust creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process\n\nWhat I came up with is something I couldn\u2019t be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I\u2019ve discovered along the way\n\nI\u2019m calling it \u201cThe 20/20 Experience,\u201d and it\u2019s coming out this year\n\nI hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019m giving you for now\u2026 I know, I know! Again, with the teasing!!!\n\nGet ready. This is going to be fun (well, at least it is for me)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/64fa37d5da3cc33fb232d6e00d93e148.398x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Timberlake"}
