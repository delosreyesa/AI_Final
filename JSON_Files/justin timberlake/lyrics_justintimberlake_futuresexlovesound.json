Do you like it like that?\nTell me which way you like that\n(Uh-huh, uh-huh) Tell me which way you like that\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can't stop, baby\nYou can't stop once you've turned me on\nAnd your enemy are your thoughts, baby\nSo just let 'em go\n'Cause all I need is a moment alone\nTo give you my tongue and put you out of control\nAnd after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin\nIt's just so natural\nWait a second\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone\nHer body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow\nMust be my future sex love sound\nAnd when it goes down, baby, all you gotta do is\nJust tell me which way you like that\n(All you gotta do is) Tell me which way you like that\nDo you like it like this?
