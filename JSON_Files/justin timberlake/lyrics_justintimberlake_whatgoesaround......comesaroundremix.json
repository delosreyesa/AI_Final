up one of those\nShe lookin like my wife thang\nBoy I need one of those\nGirl it's not a slice thang ask about me\nMy heart in the trap my money on my mind\nBut when I got you in my lap\nWe far from killing time\nAnd they say that opposites attract\nBut we both on our grind\nI love to touch you from the back\nHey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man\nYou know I gave you the world\nYou had me in the palm of your hand\nSo why your love went away\nI just can't seem to understand\nThought it was me and you babe\nMe and you until the end\nBut I guess I was wrong\nDon't want to think about it\nDon't want to talk about it\nI'm just so sick about it\nCan't believe it's ending this way\nJust so confused about it\nFeeling the blues about it\nI just can't do without ya\nTell me is this fair?\nIs this the way it's really going down?\nIs this how we say goodbye?\nShould've known better when you came around\nThat you were gonna make me cry\nIt's breaking my heart to watch you run around\n'Cause I know that you're living a lie\nThat's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around, yeah\nNow girl, I remember everything that you claimed\nYou said that you were moving on now\nAnd maybe I should do the same\nThe funny thing about that is\nI was ready to give you my name\nThought it was me and you, babe\nAnd now, it's all just a shame\nAnd I guess I was wrong\nDon't want to think about it\nDon't want to talk about it\nI'm just so sick about it\nCan't believe it's ending this way\nJust so confused about it\nFeeling the blues about it\nI just can't do without ya\nCan you tell me is this fair?\nIs this the way things are going down?\nIs this how we say goodbye?\nShould've known better when you came around (should've known better)\nThat you were going to make me cry\nNow it's breaking my heart to watch you run around\n'Cause I know that you're living a lie\nThat's okay baby 'cause in time you will find\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nThis is, ah this goes out to every couple in the world\nThat goes through the same thing which is called cheatin\nMami you know you the only one I can't control what they talk about\nYou listen to the he say she say might as well pack my shit start walkin out\nYou know they blood boil when ever they see us together\nI'm not sayin I'm an angel but damn I thought you knew me better\nWhy you listenin to these foot draggin hood rats loose tongue havin' with chicken head habits bitches\nAt the end of the day they wish they was u ain't no tellin what these bitches'll do u know it's the truth\nIf you know so much then where is the proof?\nDon't want to think about it\nDon't want to talk about it\nI'm just so sick about it\nCan't believe it's ending this way\nJust so confused about it\nFeeling the blues about it (yeah)\nI just can't do without ya\nTell me is this fair?\nIs this the way things are going down?\nIs this how we say goodbye?\nShould've known better when you came around (should've known better)\nThat you were going to make me cry\nNow it's breaking my heart to watch you run around\n'Cause I know that you're living a lie\nBut that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nWhat goes around, goes around, goes around\nComes all the way back around\nLet me paint this picture for you, baby\nYou spend your nights alone\nAnd he never comes home\nAnd every time you call him\nAll you get's a busy tone\nI heard you found out\nThat he's doing to you\nWhat you did to me\nAin't that the way it goes\nYou cheated girl\nMy heart bleeded girl\nSo it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt\nJust a classic case, scenario\nTale as old as time\nGirl you got what you deserved\nAnd now you want somebody\nTo cure the lonely nights\nYou wish you had somebody\nThat could come and make it right\nBut girl I ain't somebody I'm out of sympathy\nSee\n(What goes around comes back around)\nI thought I told ya, hey\n(What goes around comes back around)\nI thought I told ya, hey\n(What goes around comes back around)\nI thought I told ya, hey\n(What goes around comes back around)\nI thought I told ya, hey\nSee?\nHey, hey, hey, hey...\nYou should've listened to me, baby\nBecause\n(What goes around comes back around)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/64fa37d5da3cc33fb232d6e00d93e148.398x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Timberlake"}
