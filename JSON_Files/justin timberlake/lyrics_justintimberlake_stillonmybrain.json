Yeah\nEven though I try to hide my broken heart inside\nGirl, you know me inside out and I can\u2019t get you off my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I could say that I don\u2019t love you no more\nAnd I could say that I\u2019ve closed the door for our love\nAnd I can tell you I feel it\u2019s time for us to go our separate ways\nBut baby, I just wouldn\u2019t be the same\n'Cause girl your love is still on my brain, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9faaab5f9f2b59102e8a4d0252b46132.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Timberlake"}
