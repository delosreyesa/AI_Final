Is it good? And have a lil' smack fest\nSo if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee\nWashin' away my sorrows in cold cup o' Hennessy\n\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]\nLittle lady (Lady, lady)\nYou got me just (Screwed up)\nOff of your melody\nLittle lady (Lady, lady)\nCome on and don't (Chop me up)\nPlease don't make a fool of me\nLittle lady (Lady, lady)\nYou got me just (Screwed up)\nOff of your melody\nEasy, baby (Baby, baby)\nCome on, girl, don't (Chop me up)\nPlease don't make a fool of me\n\n[Outro: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]\nScrewed up\nChop me up\nScrewed up (Off of your melody)\nChop me up (Please don't make a fool of me)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/abd09da24c70a3bef7562299c43d5d59.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Timberlake"}
