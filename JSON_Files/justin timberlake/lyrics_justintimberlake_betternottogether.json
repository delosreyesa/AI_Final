What are we doin'?\nWhy can't we seem to work things out\n(What are we doin'?) What are we doin'?\nDid we forget what love was about?\n(It feels like I'm losing)Feels like I'm losing\nBut when that was everything to me\nBut now I realize we are just better not together\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's hard to let go\nGirl we've been through so many things\nBut for you to grow, it had to go and spread your wings\nI see your tears, you're searching for a brighter day\nOh, you should've thought it through when you gave my love away\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow, I don't wanna fight with you\nI've done everything I can do (everything I can do)\nI hate to leave you like that but I thought you had my back\nWe tried to work it out but it's over\n\n[Chorus]\n(What are we doin'?)
