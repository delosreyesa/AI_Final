Oooh...\n\nYou're still captivating even though it's been so long\nYou used to love me, tell me baby what went wrong\n'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song\n\nTry to understand that we needed space\nBut everywhere I turn I see your face\nI've been waiting for you to come home\n'Cause I don't want to be alone\nI still love you\n\nWhy did you take away your love\nWhen did you think to just give up\nHow am I supposed to carry on now\nWithout you\nYou are my light\n\nI have changed girl since I last saw you\nWhen you left, you don't know what you put me through\nBut my heart's still racing just being next to you\n\nI can't escape the magic in your eyes\nIs there a way to make you realize\nThere's no one more special to my heart\nBut you want us to be apart\nI still love you\n\nWhy did you take away your love, baby\nWhen did you think to just give up, yea\nHow am I supposed to carry on now\nWithout you\n\nYou were my world\nYou meant everything to me\nYou're the air I breathe\nThe song I sing\nYou were my queen, I was your king\nBut if we can try to work it\nWe'll show the world what love is about\nBaby come home cause I can't take no more\nOf this loneliness\nAnd emptiness\n\nWhy did you take away your love\n(Take away your love)\nWhen did you think to just give up\n(Oh...)\nHow am I supposed to carry on now\nWithout you\n\nWhy did you take away your love\nWhen did you think to just give up\nHow am I supposed to carry on\nWithout you\nYou are my\nYou are my light", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c86767ce013c99d3fb87d0ead1dc1d26.595x595x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Timberlake"}
