(Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nTrying my best to show appreciation, oh yeah\nBut all apologies are just a miscommunication\nNow it\u2019s like I\u2019m walking on eggshells\nTrying not to burn the hell out\nIt\u2019s like pulling magic from my mouth\nThat\u2019s when she said\nThat\u2019s when she said\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n\n[Bridge]\nCould I ever do enough to make this coffee more than bitter water?\nCould I ever do enough to make you wear this love not like a collar?\nCould I ever do enough to make you feel the way you want to feel?\nSo the next time that you\u2019re sad, tell me that\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nUh yeah, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable? (Oh-oh)\n\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nDo you want it bad?\nYeah she said, baby do ya? (Oh-oh)\nOr are you just comfortable?  (Oh-oh)\nAre you just comfortable? Oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd2468bed09fa21201ea8cd42ce91fcb.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lauv"}
