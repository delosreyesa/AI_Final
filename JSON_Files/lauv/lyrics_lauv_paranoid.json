Who do I trust?\nMaybe its real, or maybe I'm just...\n\n[Breakdown]\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever felt so naked\nLookin' at you naked\nGot your hands down the back of my soul\nAnd the more that I show you, the more I'm afraid\nThat you're going to wake up\nAnd realize that I'm not the one that you thought I was\nThat I thought I was\nAm I who I am who am I?\n\n[Chorus]\nMaybe it's a case of paranoia\nNervous that I'll never really know ya\nWhat do I feel? Who do I trust?\nMaybe its real\nOr maybe I'm just...\n\n[Breakdown]\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\nParanoid\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just\n\n[Outro]\nCrazy\nBut baby, I love you\nAnd baby I'd love to not be...\nParanoid\nParanoid\nI wish I wasn't\nParanoid\nMaybe I'm just...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b4c1c756f62eb6e482c8f02b068bb0e3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lauv"}
