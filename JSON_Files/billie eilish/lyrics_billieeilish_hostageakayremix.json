(Hello?)\nI wanna steal your soul\nAnd hide you in my treasure chest\nI don't know what to do\nTo do with your kiss on my neck\nI don't know what feels true\nBut this feels right so stay a sec\nYeah, you feel right so stay a sec\nYeah, you feel right so stay a sec\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nGold on your fingertips\nFingertips against my cheek\nGold leaf across your lips\nKiss me until I can't speak\nGold chain beneath your shirt\nThe shirt that you let me wear home\nGold's fake and real love hurts\nAnd nothing hurts when I'm alone\nWhen you're with me and we're alone\nWhen you're with me and we're alone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3f0bc04850ca72caa4479614d11c3d49.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Billie Eilish"}
