(Japanese Import)", "year": "2019-03-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhat is it about them?\nI must be missing something\nThey just keep doing nothing\nToo intoxicated to be scared\nBetter off without them\nThey're nothing but unstable\nBring ashtrays to the table\nAnd that's about the only thing they share\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm in their secondhand smoke\nStill just drinking canned Coke\nI don't need a Xanny to feel better\nOn designated drives home\nOnly one who's not stoned\nDon't give me a Xanny, now or ever\n\n[Interlude]\nCan you check your Uber rating? Oh my god\n(And it's like, wait, like, when?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWakin' up at sundown (Ooh)\nThey're late to every party (Ooh)\nNobody's ever sorry (Ooh)\nToo inebriated now to dance\nMorning as they come down (Come down)\nTheir pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)\nThey're awfully bad at learning (Learning)\nMake the same mistakes, blame circumstance\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm in their secondhand smoke\nStill just drinking canned Coke\nI don't need a Xanny to feel better\nOn designated drives home\nOnly one who's not stoned\nDon't give me a Xanny, now or ever\n\n[Bridge]\nPlease don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk\nOn your cigarette break\nI can't afford to love someone\nWho isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake\n\n[Outro]\nWhat is it about them?\nI must be missing something\nThey just keep doin' nothing\nToo intoxicated to be scared\nHmm, hmm\nHmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm\nCome down\nHurting\nLearning", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ef2bfc01092b457263dab4dcff8ce61b.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Billie Eilish"}
