Can\u2019t you tell I'm wired?\nTell me nothing lasts, like I don't know\nYou could kiss my\u2014 asking about my motto\n\n[Interlude]\nYou should enter it in festivals or carnivals\nThoughts? Pretty good reaction\nPretty cool... right?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are my strange addiction\nYou are my strange addiction\nMy doctors can't explain\nMy symptoms or my pain\nBut you are my strange addiction\n\n[Outro]\nDid you like it? Did you like that?\nUm, which part?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ef2bfc01092b457263dab4dcff8ce61b.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Billie Eilish"}
