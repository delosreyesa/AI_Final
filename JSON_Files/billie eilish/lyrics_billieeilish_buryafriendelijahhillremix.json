Why don't you run from me?\nWhat are you wondering? What do you know?\nWhy aren\u2019t you scared of me? Why do you care for me?\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?\n\n[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Crooks]\nCome here\nSay it, spit it out, what is it exactly\nYou're payin'? Is the amount cleanin\u2019 you out? Am I satisfactory?\nToday, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly\nThe way I'm drinkin' you down\nLike I wanna drown, like I wanna end me\n\n[Refrain: Billie Eilish]\nStep on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)\nBury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)\nCannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)\nBury a friend, I wanna end me\n\n[Chorus: Billie Eilish]\nWhat do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?\nWhat are you wondering? What do you know?\nWhy aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?\n\n[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Crooks]\nListen\nKeep you in the dark, what had you expected?\nMe to make you my art and make you a star\nAnd get you connected?\nI'll meet you in the park, I\u2019ll be calm and collected\nBut we knew right from the start that you\u2019d fall apart\n'Cause I\u2019m too expensive\nIt's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud\nHonestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)\nCalling security, keepin\u2019 my head held down\nBury the hatchet or bury a friend right now\n\n[Bridge: Billie Eilish]\nFor the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul\n'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no\nThen my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close\nAnd I can't say no, I can't say no\nCareful\n\n[Refrain: Billie Eilish]\nStep on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)\nBury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)\nCannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)\nBury a friend, I wanna end me\n\n[Chorus: Billie Eilish]\nWhat do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?\nWhat are you wondering? What do you know?\nWhy aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3f4c3a6b052e199900deee8cd346a64.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Billie Eilish"}
