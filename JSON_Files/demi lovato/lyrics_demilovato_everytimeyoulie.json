(Oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh no, I knew better than to let you break my heart\nThis soul you'll never see again, won't be showing scars\nOh no, no\nYou still love her\nI can see it in your eyes\nThe truth is all that I can hear every time you lie\n\n[Bridge]\nAt night, awake\nI will be sleeping 'til morning breaks\nThat's the price you pay for your mistakes\nGoodbye to dreaming\n\n[Breakdown]\nSo don't say your sorry, 'cause I'm not gonna listen\n\n[Chorus]\nI knew better than to let you break my heart\nThis soul you'll never see again won't be showing scars\nOh no, no\nYou still love her\nI can see it in your eyes\nThe truth is all that I can hear every time you lie, oh-oh\nEvery time you lie\n(Don't say you're sorry)\nEvery time you lie\n(Don't say you're sorry)\n(Hoo-ooh-ooh)\nThe truth is all that I can hear every time you lie", "image": "https://images.genius.com/32b730ce2c2894196056ba03bd76d23c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
