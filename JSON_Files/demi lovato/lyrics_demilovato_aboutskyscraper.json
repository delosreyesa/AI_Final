I realized it was, because before I went in, recording \"Skyscraper\" was kinda like my cry for help, and I think that's what really is sort of magnetic about this song when you first hear it. Because it's so raw and so vulnerable, and I'm really really proud of it. And I've heard a lot of people tell me that \"Skyscraper\" changed their lives. So I'm really proud of it and I'm still overwhelmed about the magnitude of the access that it had. It's just been amazing! It's held a very special place in my heart.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
