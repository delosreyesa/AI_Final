(Under my skin, yeah)\nSwore that I'd never let you back in (Oh)\nShould've known better than trying to let you go\n'Cause here we go, go, go again\nHard as I try, I know I can't quit (I can't quit)\nSomething about you is so addictive (Baby, it's so...)\nWe're falling together\nYou think that by now I'd know\n'Cause here we go, go, go\n\n[Outro]\nHere we go again\nHere we go again (Again)\nShould've known better\nThen trying to let you go\n'Cause here we go, go, go again\nAgain (And again and again and again)\nAgain (And again and again and again)\n(And again and again and again)\n(And again and again and again)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f335086d1153daa5fbb3fca9637cc6ea.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
