I'm really excited for you all to hear \"Unbroken\". It's my new album, and it's really different than the other ones, like \"Don't Forget\" and \"Here We Go Again\", because it's taken on more of an R&B vibe rather than the pop-rock vibe, which I normally had on the last few albums. I have collaborations with Timbaland, Iyaz, Jason Derulo, Missy Elliot and Dev, so I'm really, really excited for you all to hear them. I think you guys are gonna love it, and I hope you continue to enjoy it!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
