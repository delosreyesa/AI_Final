What you gonna do?)\nI'm gonna laugh through the summer with you\n(Who you gonna be? Who you gonna be?)\nYou'll just have to watch me carefully\n(Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?)\nAnywhere my heart wants me to go\nI'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance\nI'm gonna ride, I'm gonna play\nI'm gonna try my game in everything\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause It's a brand new day\n(Don't you see me)\nChanging up my ways\n(So completely)\nThis time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it\nThis time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit\nIt's a brand new day\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a brand new day\n(It's a brand new day)\nChanging up my ways\n(Changing up my ways)\nThis time I'm gonna sing and you're gonna hear it (gonna hear it)\nThis time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit (got the spirit)\nIt's a brand new day\n(It's a brand new day)\nIt's a brand new day\nAnd I'm feelin' good\nFeelin' good\nAnd I'm feelin' good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/96bf95a47993706229752c50ded249dd.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
