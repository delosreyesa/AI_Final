When Missy Elliot heard the song, she actually asked if she could be on the track and I could not say no because she is a rap legend. So, I said \"yes\", and the track turned out to be awesome and a lot of people had liked so far, and I hope you guys continue to like it!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
