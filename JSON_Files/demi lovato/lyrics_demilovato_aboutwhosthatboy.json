I recorded it with Dev and it was actually written by Ryan Tedder, who is the lead singer of OneRepublic, and he is really cool guy. We had a really great time in the studio. Really funny! He's awesome, and I'm really excited to say that I've been able to work with such a talented writer and producer.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
