We'll start it again\nAfter the end of the day, it keeps getting better\nDon't be afraid, we'll do it together\n\nCome on, come on, you know\nIt's your time to move it's my time to move\nCome on, come on, let go\nLeave it all behind, your past and mine\n\n[Chorus]\nGone are the days of summer\nWe couldn't change it if we tried\nWhy would we want to, let's go where we got to\nOut paths will cross again in time\nIt's never the same tomorrow\nAnd tomorrow is never clear\n\nSo come on, come on, you know\nOur time, our time is here\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe know, but were not certain\nHow can we be, how can we see what's ahead\nThe road keeps on turning\nAnd all we can do, is travel each day to the next\n\nCome on, come on, you know\nIt's your time to move it's my time to move\nCome on, come on let go\nLeave it all behind, your past and mine\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Break]\nYeah\n\n[Chorus]\nGone are the days of summer\nWe couldn't change it if we tried\n(if we tried)\nSo come on, come on, come on\nCome on, come on, come on\nSo come on, come on you know\nOur time our time\nIs here- yeah-oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58d5d2cedf05f16e9fe64937479f4847.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
