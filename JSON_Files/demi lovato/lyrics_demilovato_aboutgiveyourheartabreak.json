It's very upbeat, and it's about telling someone that you want to be that break for that person. You want to be that person that is protective and that is not gonna break the other person's heart, and that you want the other person to fall in love with you, and that you gonna take care of them. So I think it got a really beautiful message, and I think it's a fun song to dance to, and I think a lot of people will like it, and I hope that people really like the message too.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
