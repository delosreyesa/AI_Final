And one day, I decided, \"You know, I really want a techno-house-dance kinda vibe for one of my songs.\" And they said, \"Check out this beat that we have,\" and listened to it and I fell in love with it, and we instantly started writing to it. It seems to be one of my friends' favorite song, so whenever my friends wanna hear my record they always ask me to hear \"Unbroken\" first. So, I decided to name my album \"Unbroken\" because it also represents me and my journey and who I am today and after everything that I've been through, I'm still standing strong, \"like a skyscraper,\" but also \"unbroken\" and it's also my favorite songs, so, yeah.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
