It's about a break up, and the first time that I heard it, I cried, because I had just gone through a break up, and I sung the song, and I poured my heart out into it, and I just put myself back in that position into I was when I went through. Hmm, a heartache, and I think every girl, even guy can relate to this song, because break ups can never be easy. Basically, it's just a great break up song and it's really emotional and I hope you like the track!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
