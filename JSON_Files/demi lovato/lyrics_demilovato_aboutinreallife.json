In the end of the song, you know, it turn around and she finds that, that person that takes care of her, and you know, gives her sweet kisses and, you know, roses and everything. I think it's a really cute song, but I love how musically the chord progression. It's just, it kinda takes you to on this roller coaster, I think it's really cool.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fa04072ceb611d86485404abf403597.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
