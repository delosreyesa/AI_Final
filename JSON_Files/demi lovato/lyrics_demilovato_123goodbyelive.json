Promise you won't forget about me!\n\n[Chorus: Demi Lovato]\nSo these moments spent are coming to an end\nI'm counting seconds until next time begins\nListen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nWe couldn't change it if we tried\n1, 2, 3, 4 goodbye\n\n[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]\nWe've all said before, Our Time is Here\nBut it's never meant a thing until we began to tear\nAnd I'll be aching before and after we depart\nFrom remembrances of the very start\nThe grand memories together\nThe grand memories together\nNow here I am, it's your song I'll be singing\nYou're the voice I hear inside my head!\n\n[Chorus: Demi Lovato]\nSo these moments spent are coming to an end\nI'm counting seconds until next time begins\nListen 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nWe couldn't change it if we tried\n1, 2, 3, 4 goodbye\n\n[Bridge: Demi Lovato]\nWe raised our voices\nWe followed our dreams\nOne thing, 'Who Will I Be?' you ask\nWell, we'll never be too cool for Camp Rock 3!\n\n[Chorus: Demi Lovato]\nSo these moments spent are coming to an end\nI'm counting seconds until next time begins\nSo listen! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nWe couldn't change it if we tried\n1, 2, 3, 4 goodbye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82aa51872ad714590bda4560d402dc42.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Demi Lovato"}
