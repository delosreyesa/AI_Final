(oops!)\nYou're like a rush, you're like a drug, it's just the sight of you\nI like to think that I could kick you, but it's what you do\nWhen you weaken me\nWhat's the lord think of me for being so fuckin' weak?\nI find it hard for me to breathe\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo here's where my story ends\nI've got to make amends\nI let me down\nAgain and again and again and again\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanted from you\nWas a night, maybe two\nYou beat me at my own game\nNo, it's not okay\nI'm the one who's spacin' out\nAll I needed to do\nWas get just a taste of you\nAnd now I'm sick all in my head\nYou poisoned me instead\nTrust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down\n\n[Bridge]\nHere's what we have to do\nStay together, keep it true\nCan't be strong, too late for cool\nI won't not live without you\nYou're not rid of me\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I wanted from you\nWas a night, maybe two\nYou beat me at my own game\nNo, it's not okay\nI'm the one who's spacin' out (all I)\nAll I needed to do\nWas get just a taste of you\nAnd now I'm sick all in my head\nYou poisoned me instead\nTrust me, trust me, I think I got heartbreak down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1cbafe0a3469d2c69f4907c856c36183.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
