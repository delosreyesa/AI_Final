What about trust?\nWhat about us?\nOoh\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe are problems that want to be solved\nWe are children that need to be loved\nWe were willin', we came when you called\nBut man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh\n\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about us?\nWhat about all the times you said you had the answers?\nWhat about us?\nWhat about all the broken happy ever afters?\nOh, what about us?\nWhat about all the plans that ended in disaster?\nOh, what about love? What about trust?\nWhat about us?\n\n[Bridge]\nSticks and stones, they may break these bones\nBut then I'll be ready, are you ready?\nIt's the start of us, waking up come on\nAre you ready? Let them know\n\n[Outro]\nLet them know\nWhat about us?\nWhat about us", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2f36dc3aa07aaf9dfee02ba64c07adf0.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
