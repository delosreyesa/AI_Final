Echoes knocking on locked doors\nAll the laughter from before\nI'd rather live out on the street\nThan in this haunted memory I've called the movers, called the maids\nWe'll try to exorcise this place\nDrag my mattress to the yard\nCrumble, tumble house of cards This used to be a funhouse\nBut now it's full of evil clowns\nIt's time to start the countdown\nI'm gonna burn it down, down, down\nI'm gonna burn it down This used to be a funhouse\nBut now it's full of evil clowns\nIt's time to start the countdown\nI'm gonna burn it down, down, down\nI'm gonna burn it down 9, 8, 7, 6-5-4, 3, 2, 1, fun! I'm crawling through the doggy door\nMy key don't fit my life no more\nI'll change the drapes, I'll break the plates\nI'll find a new place, burn this fucker down! Do do do do, do-do do\nDo do do do, do-do do\nDo do do do, do-do do\nDo do do do, da-da-da-da!\nDo do do do, do-do do (9, 8, 7, 6-5-4, 3, 2, 1)\nDo do do do, do-do do\nDo do do do, do-do do\nDo do do do, do-do do This used to be a funhouse\nBut now it's full of evil clowns\nIt's time to start the countdown\nI'm gonna burn it down, down, down\nI'm gonna burn it down This used to be a funhouse\nBut now it's full of evil clowns\nIt's time to start the countdown\nI'm gonna burn it down, down, down\nI'm gonna burn it down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/906ca024248deb6def75001645da6857.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
