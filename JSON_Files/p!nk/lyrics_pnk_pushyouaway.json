You cannot just act normal like it never happened\"\nI took your toothbrush off the sink and then I put it back\nI rearranged the closets maniacs swinging from the racks??\nI have always hated that your shoes smell like tennis balls\nBut now I kind of really miss it\n\n[Chorus]\nI would not know just when you faded\nCount the times how long I waited for this moment to arrive\nI push you away\nI push you away\nI push you away\nNow you are gone\nYou are Gone\nYou are Gone\nI push you away\nI push you away\nI push you away\nFor so long\nSo Long\nSo Long\nI thought I could do this\nI thought I was strong\nTo pick up the pieces of where we belong\nI push you away\nI push you away\nNow you are gone\n\nI know I said, that you do not own me, just leave me alone (I am lonely)\nI wish you would never listen to me\n\n(Yeah!)\nYeahhhh!\n\n[Chorus]\nI push you away\nI push you away\nI push you away\nNow you are gone\nYou are Gone\nYou are Gone\nI push you away\nI push you away\nI push you away\nFor so long\nSo Long\nSo Long\nI thought I could do this\nI thought I was strong\nTo pick up the pieces of where we belong\nI push you away\nI push you away\nNow you are gone\n\n[Outro]\nBapaduh bapahduh a wahoo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3338e3f673583efb2e9c286f8601b6b2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
