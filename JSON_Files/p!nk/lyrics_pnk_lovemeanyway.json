(Aw, could you?)\nCould you? (Could you?)\nCould you?\nCould you love me anyway?\nCould you?\n\n[Outro: P!nk & Chris Stapleton]\nCould you? (Could you still love me?)\nCould you? (Pick up the pieces of me?)\nCould you? (Could you still love me?)\nCould you love me anyway?\nCould you? (Ooh, could you still love me?)\nCould you? (Pick up the pieces of me?)\nCould you? (Could you still love me?)\nCould you love me anyway?\nCould you? (Could you catch me when I fall?)\nCould you? (And we rise above it all)\nCould you? (And hold me when it hurts)\nI can't stay here in the world, could you?\nCould you? Could you?
