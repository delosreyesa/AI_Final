I'm still a rockstar\nI got my rock moves and I don't need you\nAnd guess what? I'm havin' more fun\nAnd now that we're done, I'm gonna show you tonight\nI'm alright\nI'm just fine and you're a tool\nSo, so what? I am a rockstar\nI got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Uh, check my flow, uh)\nThe waiter just took my table\nAnd gave it to Jessica Simps (shit!)\nI guess I'll go sit with drum boy\nAt least he'll know how to hit (oops!)\nWhat if this song's on the radio?\nThen somebody's gonna die\nI'm gonna get in trouble\nMy ex will start a fight\nNa na na na na na na, he's gonna start a fight (huh!)\nNa na na na na na na, we're all gonna get in a fight!\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, so what? I'm still a rockstar\nI got my rock moves and I don't need you\nAnd guess what? I'm havin' more fun\nAnd now that we're done, I'm gonna show you tonight\nI'm alright (I'm alright)\nI'm just fine and you're a tool\nSo, so what? I am a rockstar\nI got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nYou weren't there, you never were\nYou want it all, but that's not fair\nI gave you life, I gave my all\nYou weren't there, you let me fall\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, so what? I'm still a rockstar\nI got my rock moves and I don't need you\nAnd guess what? I'm havin' more fun\nAnd now that we're done (we're done), I'm gonna show you tonight\nI'm alright (I'm alright)\nI'm just fine (I'm just fine) and you're a tool\nSo, so what? I am a rockstar (oh)\nI got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight)\n\n[Outro]\nNo, no, no, no\nI don't want you tonight\nYou weren't there\nI'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)\nI'm alright (I'm alright)\nI'm just fine and you're a tool\nSo, so what? I am a rockstar\nI got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight!)\n\n[Outro]\nWoohoo!\nBa da da da da da", "image": "https://images.genius.com/69987c31f19b1245d55bbc5dc46c9514.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
