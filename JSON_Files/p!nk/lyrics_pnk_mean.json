How do we just move on?\nHow do you feel in the morning\nWhen it comes and everything's undone?\nIs it 'cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me\nNormally I'm so strong\nI just can't wake up on the floor\nLike a thousand times before\nKnowing that forever won't be\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm always sentimental when I think of how it was\nWhen love was sweet and new and we just couldn't get enough\nThe shower, it reminds me you'd undress me with your eyes\nAnd now you never touch me and you tell me that you're tired\nYou know it gets so sad when it all goes bad\nAnd all you think about is all the fun you've had\nAnd all those \"sorry's\" ain't never gonna mean a thing\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did we get so mean? How do we just move on?\nHow do you feel in the morning\nWhen it comes and everything's undone?\nIs it 'cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me\nNormally I'm so strong\nI just can't wake up on the floor\nLike a thousand times before\nKnowing that forever won't be\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know we said some things that we can never take back\nIt's like a trainwreck trying to hit the right track\nWe opened up the wine and we just let it breathe\nBut we should've drank it down while it was still sweet\nIt all goes bad eventually\nNow, do we stay together 'cause we're scared to be alone?\nWe got so used to this abuse, it kinda feels like home\nBut my baby, I just really wanna know, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did we get so mean? How do we just move on?\nHow do you feel in the morning\nWhen it comes and everything's undone?\nIs it 'cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me\nNormally I'm so strong\nI just can't wake up on the floor\nLike a thousand times before\nKnowing that forever won't be\nHow do we just move on?\nHow do you feel in the morning\nWhen it comes and everything's undone?\nIs it 'cause we wanna be free? Well that's not me\nNormally I'm so strong\nI just can't wake up on the floor\nLike a thousand times before\nKnowing that forever won't be", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6520f8c223a3629bad2b1caa62caabab.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
