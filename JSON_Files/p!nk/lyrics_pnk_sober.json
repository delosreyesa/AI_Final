(Oh)\nNo pain\nInside\nYou're like perfection\nBut how do I feel this good sober?\n\n[Break]\nComing down, coming down, coming down\nSpinning round, spinning round, spinning round\nLooking for myself, sober\nComing down, coming down, coming down\nSpinning round, spinning round, spinning round\nLooking for myself, sober\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad\n'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had\nI have heard myself cry, never again\nBroken down in agony, just tryna find a friend\nOh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm safe\nUp high\nNothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)\nBut why do I feel this party's over? (Why do I feel this party's over?)\nNo pain (no)\nInside (no)\nYou're like perfection\nBut how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)\nI'm safe\n(No pain)\nUp high\nNothing can touch me\nBut why do I feel this party's over? (Oh)\nNo pain\nInside\nYou're like perfection\nBut how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/49f5a3a8c56d5287450876635e234bd9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
