They want you, I swear\nYou got no worries, you got no cares\nAll you got is motherfuckers who will jock you\nYeah, you got money in your pocket\nAnd you shoot up the ground like a rocket\nYou move so fast, lord you cannot stop it\nThere you are in the club swinging\nAnd I am just standing there, standing there laughing\nAll the things people have you believing\nI feel sorry for your ass is out of season\nMaybe you should think of cutting down drinking\nBecause you look like a fat rat sinking\nI could have helped you, but you had to act out\nYou do not have a fucking clue what I am about\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you are nothing but a hooker\nSelling your fucking soul\nAnd you are nothing but a hooker\nSelling your fucking soul\n\n[Verse 2]\nI saw it coming through the line like a full back\nYou are a crack slack, a fucking rap back (yeah)\nDo not react, you are not fact\nDo not give a fuck, yes, like that\nWhat you going to do now that you are got nothing\nLook around honey, you been fronting\nEverybody knows that you are a fraud! (And I'm making records!)\nMy salutations, no hesitations\nNo reservation, just cancellation\nAnd if I blow it then I blow it\nBecause I am a poet and I know it\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you are nothing but a hooker\nSelling your fucking soul\nAnd you are nothing but a hooker\nSelling your fucking soul\n\n[Outro]\nYou want to try me\nDo not you know?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d57a6e87130979b532ab912474dbdd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
