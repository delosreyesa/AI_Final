(How?)\nNo, no, no\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)\nThat you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high (no, no, no)\nI can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)\nOoh, do you picture a better life?\n\n[Outro]\nOooh\nDo you picture a better life?\nOoh, do you picture a better life?\nAnd I wonder, and I wonder\nDo you picture a better life? (Mmm, can't shake the feeling)\nAnd I wonder (I can't shake the feeling)\nDo you picture\nDo you picture a better life?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6cfc20f443acd94a531377ce11fc0b31.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
