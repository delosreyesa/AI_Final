Oh yeah\nCan we pretend that I really like your shoes? Hell yeah\nCan we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend?\nCan we pretend?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember what we wanted\nWhat we'd never take for granted\nHow our daddy issues took us to LA\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nIf I'm honest, what I miss\nIs not knowin' what to say\nAnd the feeling of your lips\nAnd it haunts me every day\nWhen you'd tell me what you're thinking\nBut I'd already know\nScrew this, I don't wanna let it go\nOh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nSo can we pretend that I'm 22 today?\nDancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend that we all end up okay?\nI just wanna forget with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend that we both like the way it is? Hell yeah\nCan we pretend that we like these fake-ass dudes? Oh yeah\nCan we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend?\nCan we pretend that I'm 22 today?\nDancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend that we all end up okay?\nI just wanna forget with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4bda42bb8f8e718ef5fbe4d40987942e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
