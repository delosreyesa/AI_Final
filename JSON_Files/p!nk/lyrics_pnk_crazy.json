Yeah, yeah\n\nWell, I think you're crazy\nI think you're crazy\nI think you're crazy just like me\n\nMy heroes had the heart\nTo lose their lives out on a limb\nAnd all I remember\nIs thinking, I wanna be like them\n\nEver since I was little\nEver since I was little it looked like fun\nAnd it's no coincidence I've come\nAnd I can die when I'm done, yeah, yeah\n\nMaybe I'm crazy, maybe you're crazy\nMaybe we're crazy, probably", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3338e3f673583efb2e9c286f8601b6b2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
