(Were you a lonely boy?)\nAre you a lonely boy? (Are you a lonely boy?)\nHow can you say, \"No child is left behind\"?\nWe're not dumb and we're not blind (We're not blind)\nThey're all sitting in your cells\nWhile you pave the road to hell\nWhat kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?\nAnd what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?\nI can only imagine what the first lady has to say\nYou've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine\n\n[Chorus]\nHow do you sleep while the rest of us cry?\nHow do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?\nHow do you walk with your head held high?\nCan you even look me in the eye?\n\n[Bridge]\nLet me tell you 'bout hard work\nMinimum wage with a baby on the way\nLet me tell you 'bout hard work\nRebuilding your house after the bombs took them away\nLet me tell you 'bout hard work\nBuilding a bed out of a cardboard box\nLet me tell you 'bout hard work\nHard work\nHard work\nYou don't know nothing 'bout hard work\nHard work\nHard work\n\n[Outro]\nHow do you sleep at night?\nHow do you walk with your head held high?\nDear Mr. President\nYou'd never take a walk with me\nWould you?", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c7cd7234aa23022a77fb201cb5c40ad3.180x180x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
