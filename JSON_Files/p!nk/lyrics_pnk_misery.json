I sure could use some company\nOh sing it girl!\nSince he's been gone I ain't been the same\nI carry the weight like an old ball and chain\nGuess it's all meant to be\nFor love to cause such misery\n\n[Chorus: P!nk, Steven Tyler Both]\nOh misery! Oh misery!\nTell me why does my heart make a fool of me\nSeems it's my destiny\nFor love to cause me misery\n\n[Verse 2: P!nk, Steven Tyler Both]\nAnd, oh! I've been down this road before\nWith a passion that turns into pain\nAnd each time I saw love walk out the door\nI swore I'd never get caught again\nBut ain't it true? It takes what it takes\nAnd sometime we get too smart to leave\nOne more heartache for me\nAnother night of misery\n\n[Chorus: P!nk, Steven Tyler Both]\nOh! And oh misery! Oh misery!\nTell me why does my heart make a fool of me\nOh misery! Oh misery!\nTell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this\nHeart make a fool of me\nSeems its my destiny\nFor love to cause misery, oh\nMisery\nGuess its all meant to be\nFor love to cause me misery, oh, no, yeah\nMisery", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0af576584c2db758afcbc136d823cacf.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
