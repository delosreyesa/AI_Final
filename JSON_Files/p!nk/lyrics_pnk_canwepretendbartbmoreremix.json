Oh yeah\nCan we pretend that I really like your shoes? Hell yeah\nCan we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend? (Oh)\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\nCan we pretend? (Oh)\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhen you'd tell me what you're thinking\nBut I'd already know\nScrew this, I don't wanna let it go\nOh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nSo can we pretend that I'm 22 today?\nDancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend?
