That love leaves\n\n[Chorus]\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\n'Cause you're the only one that I know who'll keep them\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\nI know you'll keep them, and this is what I've done\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been down every road you could go\nI made some bad choices as you know\nSeems I've got this whole world cradled in my hands\nBut it's just like me not to understand, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\n'Cause you're the only one that I know who'll keep them\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\nI've been a bad, bad girl\n\n[Bridge]\nI\u2019ve learned my lessons young, and I turned myself around\nI've got a guardian angel tattooed on my shoulder\nShe's been watchin' over me\n\n[Chorus]\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\nCause you're the only one that I know who'll keep them\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\nI know you'll keep them, and this is what I've done\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\n'Cause you're the only one that I know who'll keep them\nDear, dear diary, I wanna tell my secrets\n\n[Outro]\nI've been a bad, bad girl\nI've been a bad, bad girl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0af576584c2db758afcbc136d823cacf.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
