Is it a surprise to be uncool?\nIt's no wonder, I'm so disconnected\n(Second message)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo tell me why you gotta laugh?\nI guess I must've missed the joke\nThe over-caffeinated bullshit's got me tired\nI guess you know just where it's at\nYou've gotta have the latest things\nKeep your friends impressed another minute longer\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI can only imagine how uncomfortable it is inside that skin\nHaving to stretch and mold to society\nAnd trouble fitting in\nDo you always think you're right, but you know you're wrong?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm tryin' so hard to get through\nI'm tryin' so hard to hear you\nThere's so much static in the line that I can barely hear the truth\nIs it any wonder I'm the fool? Is it a surprise to be uncool?\nIt's no wonder, I'm so disconnected\n\n[Bridge]\nThe person you are trying to reach, Alecia Moore\nHas been temporarily disconnected\nPlease hang up and try again later\nUnblock yourself if you wish to be connected\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm tryin' so hard to get through\nI'm tryin' so hard to hear you\nThere's so much static in the line that I can barely hear the truth\nIs it any wonder I'm the fool? Is it a surprise to be uncool?\nIt's no wonder, it's no wonder, it's no wonder\nI'm tryin' so hard to get through\nI'm tryin' so hard to hear you\nThere's so much static in the line that I can barely hear the truth\nIs it any wonder I'm the fool? Is it a surprise to be uncool?\nIt's no wonder I'm so disconnected\n\n[Outro]\n(It's no wonder, it's no wonder)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d01840e653b22f10958597a70a06c7b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
