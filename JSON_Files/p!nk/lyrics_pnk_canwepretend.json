Hell yeah\nCan we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan we pretend?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember what we wanted\nWhat we'd never take for granted\nHow our daddy issues took us to LA\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nIf I'm honest, what I miss\nIs not knowin' what to say\nAnd the feeling of your lips\nAnd it haunts me every day\nWhen you'd tell me what you're thinking\nBut I'd already know\nScrew this, I don't wanna let it go\nOh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nSo can we pretend that I'm 22 today?\nDancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend that we all end up okay?\nI just wanna forget with you, oh yeah\nCan we pretend that we both like the way it is? Hell yeah\nCan we pretend that we like these fake-ass dudes? Oh yeah\nCan we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan we pretend?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nIf I'm honest, what I liked\nWere the things we didn't know\nEvery morning, every night\nI'd be beating down your door\nJust to tell you what I'm thinking\nBut you'd already know\nScrew this, I don't wanna let it go\n\n[Chorus]\nCan we pretend that we both like the president?\nCan we pretend that you like my fake-ass shoes? Oh yeah\nCan we pretend? Cause honestly reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nCan we pretend?\nOh, can we pretend?\nCan we? Let's make believe\nCan we (Can we)\n\n[Outro]\nCan we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me\nLet's pretend, oh, let's make believe\nCan we, can we pretend?\nHonestly", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d02cf971894b7b02c9770ff38179315.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
