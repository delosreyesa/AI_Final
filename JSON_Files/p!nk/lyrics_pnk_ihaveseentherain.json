He wrote it back in Vietnam about 40 years ago, and I grew up singing it with him at different Vietnam Vet functions. It's how I learned to harmonize and how to love an acoustic guitar, and the way that we recorded it; it was my Dad's first time in a recording studio, and he always said \"singers don't really have to work too hard\" - and he changed his mind that day. But we did it live, him and I in the vocal booth together, him playing and singing and me harmonizing. One take, straight through. It was a really, really good time, it was really special to be able to record a song with my Dad, the first song I ever learned. We hope you like it and we dedicate it to all the Vets out there\n\n[Verse 1]\nI have seen the rain\nI have felt the pain\nI don't know where I'll be tomorrow\nI don't know where I'm going\nI don't even know where I've been\nBut I know, I'd like to see them again\n\n[Chorus]\nSpend my days just searching\nSpend my nights in dreams\nStop looking over my shoulder, baby\nI've stopped wondering what it means\nDrop out, burn out, soldier home\nOh, they've said I should've been more\nProbably so if I hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war\n\n[Verse 2]\nI have seen the rain\nI've survived the pain\nOh, I've been home 30 years or so\nAnd I'm just stepping off of the plane\n\n[Chorus]\nSpend my days just searching\nSpend my nights in dreams\nStop looking over my shoulder, baby\nI've stopped wondering what it means\nDrop out, burn out, soldier home\nOh, they've said I should've been more\nProbably so if I hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe have seen the rain, together\nWe've survived the pain, forever\nOh, it's good to home again\nIts good to be with my friends\nOh, it's good to be home again\nIt's good to feel that rain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2039221900f46ee33cf9c25f7241ba9b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
