Is it my turn, P!nk?)\nSaid I will say it again, you are my only friend\n(I protect you from the world, I basically protect you from yourself)\nThough I can't go on, I am not satisfied with this being the end\n(This is just the beginning)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me why can't I just reach up and simply touch the sky\nTell me why I can't spread my arms and fly and fly and fly\nTell me why can't I say this, why can't I do that\nTell me what they want from me, tell me how to act\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you help me?\nDoes anybody hear me?\nCan they even see me?\nThis is my reality, oh, oh\nCan you help me?\nDoes anybody hear me?\nCan they even see me?\nThis is my reality, oh, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nSo I am putting it all on the table (Tell them, P!nk)\nYou do not know me well enough to label me\nSick, or even disturbed\nWhen you break it down I am just two girls\nTrying to blend, trying to vibe (Trying)\nTrying to live just one life (So hard)\nEverybody is got insanities, I got a split personality\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTell me why can't I just reach up and simply touch the sky (Why can't you)\nTell me why I can't spread my arms and fly and fly and fly (You can)\nTell me why can't I say this, why can't I do that (Just do it)\nTell me what do they want from me, tell me how to act (I can't, I can't)\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you help me?\nDoes anybody hear me?\nCan they even see me?\nThis is my reality, oh, oh\nCan you help me?\nDoes anybody hear me?\nCan they even see me?\nThis is my reality, oh, oh\nCan you help me?\nDoes anybody hear me?\nCan they even see me?\nThis is my reality, oh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nCan you help me\n(Talk to me, talk to me, do not ignore me, I can't take it)\nDo you hear me?\nDo you see me every time?\n(Oh calm down, it is not that serious, we will be just fine without them)\nIt is all mine, it is my reality it is just too much for me\n(You are my friend, you are my friend, P!nk!
