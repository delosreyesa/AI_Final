What's your problem?\nI see you trying to hurt me bad\nDon't know what you're up against\nMaybe you should reconsider\nCome up with another plan\nBecause you know I'm not that kinda girl\nThat'll lay there and let you come first\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can push me out the window\nI'll just get back up\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck\nAnd I won't give a fuck\nYou can hang me like a slave\nI'll go underground\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler but\nYou can't keep me down, down, down, down\n\n[Break]\nCan't keep me down, down\nCan't keep me down, down, down\nCan't keep me down, down\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey, hey, girl! Are you ready for today?\nYou got your shield and sword?\nCuz its time to play the games\nYou are beautiful\nEven though your not for sure\nDon't let him pull you by the skirt\nYou're gonna get your feelings hurt\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can push me out the window\nI'll just get back up\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck\nAnd I won't give a fuck\nYou can hang me like a slave\nI'll go underground\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler but\nYou can't keep me down, down, down, down\nYou can push me out the window\nI'll just get back up\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck\nAnd I won't give a fuck\nYou can hang me like a slave\nI'll go underground\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler but\nYou can't keep me down, down, down, down\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverywhere that I go\nThere's someone waiting to chain me\nEverything that I say\nThere's someone trying to short-change me\nI am only this way\nBecause of what you have made me\nAnd I'm not gonna break!\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can push me out the window\nI'll just get back up\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck\nAnd I won't give a fuck\nYou can hang me like a slave\nI'll go underground\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler but\nYou can't keep me down, down, down, down\nYou can push me out the window\nI'll just get back up\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck\nAnd I won't give a fuck\nYou can hang me like a slave\nCan't, keep me, can't keep me\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler but\nYou can't keep me down, down, down, down\nYou can push me out the window\nI'll just get back up\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck\nAnd I won't give a fuck\nYou can hang me like a slave\nI'll go underground\nYou can run over me with your 18 wheeler but", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0af576584c2db758afcbc136d823cacf.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
