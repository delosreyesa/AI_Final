Where did you go?\nHow did you know to get out of a world gone mad?\nHelp me let go\nOf the chaos around me\nThe devil that hounds me\nI need you to tell me\nChild, be still\nChild, be still\n\n[Verse 2]\nBroken hearts all around the spot\nI can't help thinking that we lost the plot\nSuicide bomber and a student shot\nTokyo, I think we got a problem\nBut for that they've got a pill\nIf that don't kill you then the side effects will\nIf we don't kill each other then the side effects will\nCape Town, I think we got a problem\n\n[Chorus]\nAve Mary A\nWhere did you go? Where did you go?\nHow did you know to get out of a world gone mad?\nHelp me let go\nOf the chaos around me\nThe devil that hounds me\nI need you to tell me\nChild, be still\n\n[Bridge]\nIf the darkest hour comes\nBefore the light\nWhere is the light?\nWhere is the light?\nIf the darkest hour comes\nBefore the light\nWhere is the light?\nWhere is the light?\nWhere is the light?\nYeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAve Mary A\nWhere did you go?\nWhere did you go?\nHow did you know to get out of a world gone mad?\nHelp me, help me, let go\nOf the chaos around me\nThe devil that hounds me\nI need you to tell me\n\n[Outro]\nChild, be still\nChild, be still\nChild, be still", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6520f8c223a3629bad2b1caa62caabab.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
