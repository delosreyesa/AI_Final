We hope your flight is enjoyable and our flight attendants are here to insure your ride is as pleasant as possible. Seat backs and tray tables must be in the upright and locked position during take-off and landing. All carry-on luggage must be stowed in an over-head compartment or under the seat in front of you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWaiting on a ticket\n'Cause you're looking for the ride\nYou're feeling on top\n'Cause you're flying through the sky\nYou wanna have your cake\nAnd you wanna eat it too\nEverybody's always pointing fingers at you\nYou're damned if you do\nYou're damned if you don't\nWe're always doing all the things\nThat we say we won't\n\n[Chorus]\nHere we go\nWe're riding on a whim\nConnecting with a rendezvous\nHere we go\nWe're jumping off the wings\nWe're going round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, we're flying round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, were rocking round in circles\nIt's the catch-22\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you are seated in an emergency exit aisle and feel as though you are unable or unwilling to assist in case of an emergency, please notify a flight attendant immediately. All electrical equipment, including cell phones, 2-way pagers, portable CD players, laptops, etc. Should remain in the off position until the pilot notifies us that we at a safe flying altitude of 10,000 ft\n\n[Verse 4]\nLooking from the outside\nYou're always looking in\nYou think you fixed the problem\n'Till it comes right back again\nAnd life seems like a trap\nYou're trying to get out\nYou're searching for you cheese\n'Cause you feel like mighty mouse\nYou're damned if you don't\nYou're damned if you do\nYou've seen all the signs\nBut you haven't got a clue\n\n[Chorus]\nHere we go\nWe're riding on a whim\nConnecting with a rendezvous\nHere we go\nWe're jumping off the wings\nWe're going round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, we're flying round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, were rocking round in circles\nIt's the catch-22\n\n[Bridge]\nYou are in, you are in\nYou are in, you are in\nYou are in for the ride\nOf your life\n\n[Chorus]\nHere we go\nWe're riding on a whim\nConnecting with a rendezvous\nHere we go\nWe're jumping off the wings\nWe're going round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, we're flying round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, were rocking round in circles\nIt's the catch-22\n\n[Verse 5]\nWe realize you had many choices and on behalf of all of us at Pink Airlines, we'd like to thank you for flying with us. We hope you have a wonderful stay wherever your destination may be. And remember, be careful when retrieving your items as during the flight they may have shifted and might fall on you, or your neighbor's head and knock you the fuck out\n\n[Chorus]\nHere we go\nWe're riding on a whim\nConnecting with a rendezvous\nHere we go\nWe're jumping off the wings\nWe're going round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, we're flying round in circles\nIt's a catch-22\nYes, were rocking round in circles\nIt's the catch-22", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0af576584c2db758afcbc136d823cacf.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
