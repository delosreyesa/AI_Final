Tell me who you are\nNot what you've rehearsed, all the other parts\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt is of no interest at all to me\nWhat you have or who you know\nCan you tell me just where you have been?\nAnd what you've learned from it all\nTell me what you dance for\nHow you've been a fool\nI don't want the headlines, I just want the truth\n\n[Chorus]\nIt would be so good to see the real you again\nIt's been a long time, my friend\nIf this is the last song of your life\nThen I'm inviting you to get it right\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen you're authentic, you're incredible\nI like the view behind your eyes\nThere was no one else who could break it down\nAnd cut right through to the heart\nI just wanna lie underneath this tree\nWhile you whisper secrets on a melody\n\n[Chorus]\nIt would be so good to see the real you again\nIt's been a long time, my friend\nIf this is the last song of your life\nThen I'm inviting you to get it right", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d02cf971894b7b02c9770ff38179315.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "P!nk"}
