So, here it is, this is \"The Edge of Glory\"\nSo grandma, if you're watching at home, this song's for you\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere ain't no reason you and me should be alone\nTonight, yeah, baby\nBut I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight\nI need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong\nTonight, yeah, baby\nTonight, yeah, baby\nRight on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's hot to feel the rush\nTo brush the dangerous\nI'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you\nWhere we can both fall far in love\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm on the edge of glory\nAnd I'm hangin' on a moment of truth\nI'm on the edge of glory\nAnd I'm hangin' on a moment with you\nI'm on the edge\nThe edge, the edge, the edge\nThe edge, the edge, the edge\nI'm on the edge of glory\nAnd I'm hangin' on a moment with you\nI'm on the edge with you\n\n[Break: Spoken]\nOne of my favorite memories with my grandpa and my grandma right around Thanksgiving, and it's actually leading up to Christmas time, is that they make these cookies called pizzelle's. If you're Italian, you know what those are. They're like really flat waffles, but they're really thin and crisp. My grandpa would always make the pizzelle and would always work the machine, and everybody had to \"I got it, outta the way, outta the way, outta the way\". That was my grandfathers thing, he made the pizzelle's, so I don't know why, but right now, I'm just thinking about the Italian cookies\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnother shot, before we kiss the other side\nTonight, yeah, baby\nI'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight\n(Alright! Alright!)\nPut on your shades, I know your dancin' the flames\nTonight, yeah, baby\nTonight, yeah, baby\nOh, it isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's hot to feel the rush\nTo brush the dangerous\nI'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you\nWhere we can both fall far in love\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm on the edge of glory\nAnd I'm hangin' on a moment of truth\nI'm on the edge of glory\nAnd I'm hangin' on a moment\nBaby, with you\nI'm on the edge\nThe edge, the edge, the edge\nThe edge, the edge, the edge\nI'm on the edge of glory\nAnd I'm hangin' on a moment\nI'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you\nWith you, with you, with you, with you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/34d4635e52b13f7302dc59b33a0b5acf.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
