Because when I meet my hotel room by myself I can still hear you cheering me there when I close my eyes\nWhen I wrote this album, I wanted to create something full of joy. A celebration, something that took all my mess and all my pain and turned it into the most beautiful schizophrenic psychedelic dance. Full of color, loud electronic music\nThe most outrageous fashion, something nearly impossible to follow, like my heart, like my mind\nSomething I couldn\u2019t keep control of\nSometimes we constantly run away from ourselves to keep up with the universe. But with this album I felt free\nAnd if you love ARTPOP then you have no idea how we are so similar\nThank you\nSo, as much as I enjoy performing this show, laughs Are you saying something?\n*gets on her knees* Hello! Oh, my hair! *gets up*\nI enjoy performing this show for you every night and I hope that you loved it\nEverybody watching on Yahoo, we love you. Everybody here in Paris, we love you\nBut I\u2019d wish to tell you something. I know we\u2019ve put up a show, and, I have the most amazing dancers, the most amazing band, the most incredible crew. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to the entire crew for this whole tour, I lcve you so much. But, the real show\n\nThe real show every night is the one in the audience. You are so full of passion, so full of freedom\nSo please, my sweet little monsters, in the most non-traditional of request, I the performer, ask you to accept our deepest applause *smiles*\n\n[Intro]\nYou were spectacular!

And talked about love, and art, all night long\nEvery year, when I travel around the world, I always wonder if things will be different. Maybe one year you won\u2019t come to the show. Or you\u2019ll be less festive or, not dressed up or, something different\nBut what I realised, during ARTPOP, is that we belong together and some stories have no end\nI will follow you, around the world, as long as you have me\nBecause I love making music, I love making art. And I love, love meeting all of you beautiful creative people\nWhen this song is over, the clock will start ticking, until\u2026 the next time\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes a story has no end\nSometimes I think that we could just be friends..\n\"'Cause I'm a wandering man,\" he said to me\n\"And what about the future plans?\nDoes this thing we have even makes sense?\nWhen I got the whole world in front of me?\"\n\nI appreciate you so much. Thank you for believing in, in me always. I\u2019ll always believe in you\nWhen I die, they\u2019ll say: \u201cLady Gaga was special. But her fans, her monsters, they were really something.\u201d\n\n[Chorus 1]\nSo, I said...\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gcpsy life\nI don't wanna be alone forever\nMaybe we can see the world together\nI don't wanna be alone forever\nTaylor, im coming home! *smile*\nBut I can be..\nCOME ON!!\nTonight!\nTonight!\n\n[Verse 2]\nPUT YOUR HANDS UP !\nSo I just packed my baggage, and\nSaid goodbye to family and friends\nAnd took a road to nowhere on my own\nLike Dorothy on a yellow brick\nHope my ruby shoes get us there quick\n'Cause I left everyone I love at home!\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight\nI don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life\nI don't wanna be alone forever\nMaybe we can see the world together\nI don't wanna be alone forever, But I can be WITH PARIS TONIIIIIIGHT!!!\n\n\nPut your hands up for DJ White Shadow, DJ Zedd, and Red One\nAnd we can't forget Billy, and all of you ! I lcve you so much! *claps*\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd then he asked me, he said\n\"Baby, why do we love each other?\"\nI said, \"Honey, it's simple !\nIt's the way that you love and treat your mother.\"\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight\nI'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life\nAnd you'll be my little gcpsy princess\nPack your bags and we can chase the sunset\nBust the rearview and PARIS\n'Cause it's you and me\nEVERYBODY ALL TOGETHER COME ON!! *sings* BABY FOR LIFEEE!!!!\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm\nI'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy, I'm\n\n[Outro]\nRussia, UK, Paris\nI'm Italian, Asian kompai\nAfrica, India, I'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy\nI'm Latin-American\nI don't speak German, but I try\nSomeday in Jakarta\nI'm American, I'm gcpsy\nI'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia\nSweden, Finland, Norway\nBe my home just for the day\nI'm a gcpsy, gcpsy, gcpsy\nHey...\n\nThank you so much!
