And do you find there\u2019s a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity: is there a kind of Gaga fan who has a commonality?\n\nLG: Yes, there is. The little monsters are a community and it\u2019s kind of nice that everywhere I go they create a little home for me.\n\nSF: Both those who, I suppose, describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you, as I do I\u2019m unashamed to say, would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed, the marginal, the freakish, the outsider, the sexually different, the ugly, the fat, the one who doesn\u2019t fit in, the one who feels outside the tribe, if you like.\n\nLG: Yes, it could be anybody.\nSF: Which, in fact, is most of us. None of us really feels we belong, just some of us are better at hiding it than others.\nLG: I think so. Some of us wear the mask prouder than others.\nSF: Yes. Exactly. And the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that, I suppose, Born This Way and the title song of it.\nLG: Yes. The album is about being able to be reborn over and over again throughout your life.\nSF: Oh, so it\u2019s not just that God made me gay or God made me lesbian or God made me bi, and that\u2019s who I am?\nLG: No.\nSF: It\u2019s about being reborn, is it?\nLG: No, not really.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/115601af3922510180f1dccb62096085.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
