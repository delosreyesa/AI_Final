Oh, oh, oh\nI'd rather save an angel down\n\n[Verse 2]\nDoesn't everyone belong\nIn the arms of the sacred?\nWhy do we pretend we're wrong?\nHas our young courage faded?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShots were fired on the street\nBy the church where we used to meet\nAngel down, angel down\nWhy do people just stand around?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a believer, it's a trial\nFoolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh\nI'd rather save an angel down\nI'm a believer, it's chaos\nWhere are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh\nI'd rather save an angel down\n\n[Bridge]\nHoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo\nHoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo\nHoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo\nHoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a believer, it's a trial\nFoolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh\nI'd rather save an angel down\nI'm a believer, it's chaos\nWhere are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh\nI'd rather save an angel down\n\n[Outro]\nSave that angel\nCatch that angel\nSave that angel\nCatch that angel\nSave that angel\nCatch that angel\nSave that angel\nCatch that angel\nCatch that angel", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eed1676c9dda497cc0ef5d45153f17fd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
