Get outta here kid!\n\n[Chorus]\nShake your head cause she wants you\nClose your eyes and see through\nComing, coming, coming, coming, coming of the girls names\nFeel so retrosexual (sexual)\nFeel so retrosexual, sexual, sexual, sexual\nSexual", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c3072ad7737d80f6996db299e72e55e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
