They are extremely conservative, extremely right-wing, and all that we have to do, all that you have to do is be louder than them\nBecause you are on the right side of history, you are on the side of love, the side of acceptance, the side of tolerance\nSo don\u2019t you let them bring you down, don\u2019t you let them think they\u2019re setting you back \u2018cause they\u2019re not, they\u2019re just a F bunch of winey b*s\nI don\u2019t mean that as fighting words but, you know, it\u2019s 2014 and people are getting together\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy mama told me when I was young\nWe're all born superstars\nShe rolled my hair and put my lipstick on\nIn the glass of her boudoir\n\"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are\"\nShe said, \"'Cause He made you perfect, babe\"\n\"So hold your head up, la France you'll go far\nListen to me when I say\"!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm beautiful in my way\n'Cause God makes no mistakes\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\nDon't hide yourself in regret\nJust love yourself, and you're set\nI'm on the right track, baby\nI was born this way\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nBaby, I was born this way\nOoh, there ain't no other way\nBaby, I was born this way\nRight track, baby\nI was born this way\n\n[Verse 2]\nGive yourself prudence and love your friends\nSubway kid, rejoice your truth\nIn the religion of the insecure\nI must be myself, respect my youth\nA different lover is not a sin\nBelieve capital \"H\"im\nHey, hey, hey\nI love my life, I love this friends and\nMi amore vole fe yah! yeah-ah!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm beautiful in my way\n'Cause God makes no mistakes!\nI'm on the right track, baby\n*point mic*\nDon't hide yourself\n*point mic*\n*plays*\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOoh, there ain't no other way!\nBaby, I was born this way\nBaby, I was born this way\nOoh, there ain't no other way\n\n[Pause]\nSo, if you are living in France, whether you\u2019re young, or old, or in the middle, if you\u2019re gay, hold your head up high and be F proud and live your life\nAnd if anybody here feels uncomfortable with this conversation you probably shouldn\u2019t have come to this concert. Here we spread love with every invention that we make. You don\u2019t have to feel invisible, you don\u2019t have to feel like you don\u2019t matter\n\n[Bridge]\nNo matter gay, straight, or bi\nLesbian, transgender life! *hold notes*\nYour on the right track, baby\nYou are born to survive\nNo matter black, white, or beige\nParis..\nWe're all born superstars!\n*plays*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/115601af3922510180f1dccb62096085.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
