Thank you! :)\n\nAnd I just want to take a, take a little poll here. Don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s not gonna offend me, I just wanna know, how many of you here tonight in the audience don\u2019t know who Joanne is?\nOh. I think many people are a bit lost\nBut, if you do know who Joanne is, that\u2019s amazing\nAnd for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who\u2019s Joanne? *laughs*\nAnd that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents\nBut Joanne, was also the name of my father\u2019s sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus\nThis loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table\nI thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father\nSo when I asked of all of you tonight, it\u2019s even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know\nAnd many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky\nAnd as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much\nSo much that you don\u2019t even remember who you were before\n\nFor me, that pain has only one name, and it\u2019s Joanne\n\n*whispers* one, two, three\n*plays guitar*\n\nTake my hand, stay Joanne\nHeaven\u2019s not ready for you\u2026\n\nGirl, where do you think you\u2019re going, where do you think you\u2019re going, going girl?\nGirl, where do you think you\u2019re going! Girl\n\n\nWe both know, things don\u2019t work that way\nI promised I, wouldn\u2019t say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin\n\nGirl, where do you think you\u2019re going?\n\nHonestly I know where you\u2019re going\n\nAnd I\u2019ll still love you even if I can\u2019t see you anymore. Can\u2019t wait to see you soar\n\nJoanne middle stop speech:\nHello gentlemen\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself\nI tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home\n\n*sits*\n*whispers* one, two, three\n\n*plays guitar*\n\nGirl, where do you think you\u2019re going, where do you think you\u2019re going, going girl!\nGirl, where do you think you\u2019re going, where do you think you\u2019re going, going, gi-oh-rl!\n\nCall me Joanne\n\nXo Joanne\n\nXoXo all our pain, makes us this way, it made me who I am\n\nJoanne", "image": "https://images.genius.com/115601af3922510180f1dccb62096085.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
