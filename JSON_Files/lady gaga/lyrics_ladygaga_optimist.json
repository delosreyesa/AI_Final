You can't bring be down anymore baby\n(My) Future is bright\n(Can't) Wait to face the day\nThere's one thing you should know about me. (Mee...)\n\nIm an optimist. (Stop!)\nSo positive. (Bitch!)\nYou'll never get another chance with me baby\nIm an optimist. (Out!)\nSo positive. (Bitch!)\nYour chances blown, boy you're gone, spread your negativity\n\n(I'm an optimist, toppop-timist-toppop-timist)\n\nYou're such a downer, You're never satisfied\nLucky for me, there's always a silver line\nOn the horizon, so boy dont even try\nInjectin' me with your negative vibes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/115601af3922510180f1dccb62096085.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
