Long live the king!\"\n\nOne minute I held the key\nNext the walls were closed on me\nAnd I discovered that my castles stand\nUpon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a ringing\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singing\nBe my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth\nMy missionaries hidin' in foreign trenches\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nOnce you'd gone there was never\nNever an honest word\nAnd that was when I ruled the world\n\nIt was the wicked and wild wind\nLike just The Doors' Love Her Madly and let her in\nShattered windows and the sound of drums\nPeople couldn't believe what I'd become\n\nRevolutionaries wait\nFor my blonde head on a silver plate\nJust a GaGa on a lonely string\nOh who would ever want to be queen?\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singin'\nBe my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth\n\nFor some reason that I can't explain\nI know Yves Saint Laurent, no, he won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\n\nI hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'\nRoman Cavalry choirs are singin'\nBe my Chris and I'll be your Gwyneth\nThe fame won't change us if we don't let it\n\nFor some reason I can't explain\nI know Saint Mary won't call my name\nNever an honest word\nBut that was when I ruled the world\nRuled the world\nRuled the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/115601af3922510180f1dccb62096085.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
