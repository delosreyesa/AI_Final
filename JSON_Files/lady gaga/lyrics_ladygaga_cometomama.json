Catch 'em!}\nThey all tell you that freedom must be bought\nBut baby, he's already caught 'em\nSo why do we gotta tell each other how to live?\nThe only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in\n\n[Chorus]\nCome to mama\nTell me who hurt ya\nThere's gonna be no future\nIf we don't figure this out\nOh, come tomorrow\nWho are you gonna follow?\nThere's gonna be no future\nIf we don't figure this out\n\n[Outro]\nCome to mama (Come onto me)\n(Woah, oh-oh oo oh-oo-oh)\n(Woah, oh-oh oo oh-oo-oh)\nCome on mama\nCome on mama\nCome on mama\nWoohoo-hoo woohoo hoo-oo-hoo\nWoohoo-hoo woohoo hoo-oo-hoo\n'Cause I wanna be there\nI wanna be there for you\nI wanna be there\nWhy do we gotta tell each other how to live?\nThe only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in\nWhy do we gotta tell each other how to live?\nLook what that rainbow did\nOo-hoo woohoo-oo-hoo woohoo-hoo\nOo-hoo woohoo-oo-hoo woohoo-hoo\nOo-hoo woohoo-oo-hoo woohoo-hoo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eed1676c9dda497cc0ef5d45153f17fd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Gaga"}
