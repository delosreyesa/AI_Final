I'm feeling so cold\nI'll be waitin' right here for you 'till the day you're home\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCarry on\nGive me all the strength I need\nTo carry on\n\n[Bridge]\nSo let the light guide your way, yeah\nHold every memory as you go\nAnd every road you take\nWill always lead you home, home\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's been a long day without you, my friend\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWe've come a long way from where we began\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWhen I see you again\n\nWhen I see you again\nWhen I see you again\nSee you again\nWhen I see you again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bcedc12bf313e376b5d6a3b25ba9c3d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlie Puth"}
