(tell me)\nOh, we don't talk anymore\nLike we used to do\nI miss you\n\n\n[Outro: Charlie Puth / Selena Gomez]\nDon't wanna know\nWhat kind of dress you're wearing tonight\nIf he's giving it to you just right\nThe way I did before\nI overdosed\nShould've known your love was a game\nNow I can't get you out of my brain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5116a0b7c48cdf22deae397b7b1a51b9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlie Puth"}
