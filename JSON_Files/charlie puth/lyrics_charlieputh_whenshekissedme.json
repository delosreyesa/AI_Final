Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I took her down to the shoreline\nThe weather that day was so fine\nAnd not to mention she looked pretty good too\nAnd later at the movies, romantic comedy\nI hate those films but for her I managed to get through\nI walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes\nAs I desperately tried to say something she put her finger on my lip and said one more thing\n\n[Chorus]\nShe kissed me and knocked me off my feet\nNever have I ever felt this way\nI was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her\nAnd I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's nice to know that she cares enough about me\nI never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming\nAnd whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same\nAbout that other girl's name\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause she kissed me and knocked me off my feet\nNever have I ever felt this way\nI was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her\nAnd I'll always let her know that I will never let her go\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af5943047ba00d22df4d61bb61feb03a.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlie Puth"}
