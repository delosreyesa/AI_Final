Oh my\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nWho threw this pickle at me?\nWho threw this pickle at me?\nCan't you see I'm tryna eat my bagel?\nWho threw this pickle at me?\n\nWho threw this pickle at me?\nWho threw this pickle at me?\nI tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure\nBitch, this ****'s not even kosher", "image": "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiv1vi9np_kAhWFVt8KHeClAwAQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dill-pickles-recipe-1950656&psig=AOvVaw22lzAZNVBUqUzgfp3j0Zd7&ust=1566864290539534"}], "artist": "Charlie Puth"}
