Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\nI thought that I'd be better when I found someone new\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBaby, no, oh, cheating on you\nBaby, no\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n\n[Verse 2]\nThought I could get you back any time of day\nShouldn't have been so cocky\nShouldn't have did you wrong (Woah)\nAnd now I miss you bad, really, really bad\nGuess you don't know what you got until it's gone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)\nOh, your love was everything, everything, everything (Everything)\nI know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late (Gettin' late)\nBut can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too\n(You said it too, baby)\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n(Cheating on you)\nI thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (Ooh)\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBaby, no, oh, cheating on you\nBaby, no\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby, no\nThere ain't no lips like your lips\nAnd nobody else feels like this\nThere's no moving on, I'll admit\nIf you go away, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n(Cheating on you)\nI thought that I'd be better when I found someone new\n(Found someone new)\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n(Believe it, baby)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBaby, no, oh, cheating on you (I said goodbye, but I'm still in love)\nBaby, no (I said goodbye, but I'm still in love)\nBut when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you\n\n[Outro]\nI said goodbye\nAnd you said goodbye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dc433ffdd55f1c38829dfd89c98fdb9c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlie Puth"}
