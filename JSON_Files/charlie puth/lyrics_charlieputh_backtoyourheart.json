Why are you talking to me?\nYou're the new kid in town and you look like you're three\nAnd it's easy to see by your pale-ass skin\nThat you're always home alone, McCauley Caulkin\"\nI need consultin' for all of my fears\n'Cause I didn't have another girl for four more years\nAnd they gave me every one of their gracing chances\nPaid no attention to all their advances\nBut freshman in college I found my first love\nAnd I took her out to dinner and I thanked the gods above\nBut when she went to give me a kiss had a pain in my stomach\nToo much food, had to vomit\n(Ugh, we should do this again sometime -- BLUGH)\n\n[Chorus: Jackson 5 Sample (Charlie Puth)]\n(Ugh, I swear this never happens)\nWon't you please let me\nBack to your heart\n(Oh baby please give me another chance! We could go to the good-house garden)\nWon't you please let me (Yeah)\nBack to your heart\n\n[Verse 2: Mike Ballz]\nMike Ballz did it, oh!\nOh damn\nThese girls all assessing me\nIn a line-up, but they ain't selecting me\nI'm too obedient and missing one ingredient\nI need a little L-O-V-E up in this recipe (Yup)\nBut they say \"nice guys finish last\"\nSo I gotta be an ass if I win my class\nNah, nope, I just can't do it\nMaybe they'll be feeling me now I that make some music\nMaybe not, I'll go right till I'm famous\nFlaunt all of my swag, I'll snag me at A-list\nHey, Taylor Swift, are you feeling this?\nGive a rapper a chance\nSomebody make sure that she's hearing this\nBut I'm for real, shit, I just need a chance\nSeventh grade girls were laughing at me when I ripped my pants\nI'm no Brad Pitt or George Clooney\nBut I'm a real dude that can make your life feel like a movie\n\n[Chorus: Jackson 5 Sample (Mike Ballz and Charlie Puth)]\n(Well, uh, probably a low budget movie, actually)\nWon't you please let me (Yeah)\nBack to your heart (With\u2026 With a lot less special effects)\n(But, it'll be really cool)\nWon't you please let me\n(You probably wouldn't die in the end)\n\n[Breakdown: Charlie Puth, Mike Ballz and the Jackson 6]\nLadies, this your chance\n(Grape jam)\nPut up your hands\n(Or any other body part)\nWave 'em side to side\nLet's ride\n(Eh, that was lame)\nYeah\nIt's Mike Ballz, baby\nIt's Mike Ballz, baby\nIt's Mike Ballz, baby\nIt's Charlie Puth, baby\nIt's Mike Ballz, and Charlie Puth (oh no)\nWe're chilling up in that booth\n(John Wilkes)\nBut it's not really a booth\n'Cause it's just in his living room\n(Very convenient)\nIt's right next to the kitchen\n(Uh)\nYo, Charlie, what you dishing?\n(Domino's Pizza)\nDo you watch the dishes (Won't you please let me)\n(Nah)\n'Cause you got some dishes in your sink\nThat sucks\nWash your dishes, son\nBoom!\n(Charlie Puth, bitch)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b0327cb5334e8db261019731dfd04791.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlie Puth"}
