Or like it was?\nDoes he ever send you roses just because\nAnd would he hold you?\nAll through the night?\nWrite a half a million songs to make it right\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere's no place that I'd rather be\nThen when you're here right, next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nOooh, is he really gonna love you\nOr just let you go? (just let you go)\nBaby no-oh, does he really mean it\nWhen he says you're beautiful\nOr is he full of shit?\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow many times would\nHe say goodbye?\nAll he ever seems to do is make you cry\nDo you still think of me\nEvery single day?\nCause our life was comfortable in every way\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere's no place that I'd rather be\nThen when you're here right, next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nOooh, is he really gonna love you\nOr just let you go?
