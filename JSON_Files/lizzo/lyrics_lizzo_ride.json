Take it, you can't man up? K then\nBreaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!\n\n[Hook]\nAnd we keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\nAnd we keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\n\n[Verse 2]\nFlying into Paris with Sophia Eris\nHad a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant\nWondering why these dudes be tripping\nShe like \"Girl I'm past giving a damn!\"\nYOLO, guess that's why he want a photo\nDressed in Polo, arm around me after the show\nBut never there when I need hoes\nOpen mind but my heart closed, ah!\nWhere ya been? Back again, young man?\nI remember you from way way when\nYou never gave it or reciprocated\nBut when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake\n\"She left me\" is always the excuse\nI swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo\nMeet once a week and deal with y'all issues\nGoogle me and jack off in a tissue\n\n[Hook]\nYeah! You know what though?\nWe keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\nAnd we keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\n\n[Verse 3]\nI will never be the person that you want me to\nFeeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do\nBut I'm here now, like how this happen?\nHead in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n\nI'm chilling, I swear I been chilling\nTaking a break, feeling hella breakable\nI was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no\nBet I made some, granted\nBut my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite\nWrote this song halfway to Chicago\nWondering if I should call you\nWhat, to make you feel special?\nWould it give me reasons to forget you?\n(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message..)\nI'm out of state, out of time\nYou more like out of sight, out of mind\n\n[Hook]\nYeah! You know what though?\nWe keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\nAnd we keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/79a88b703a7b11b709c0d78a72e68b2c.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
