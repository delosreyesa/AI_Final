Hardly, I feel lazy\nI was eating ph\u1edf when I wrote this\nFever, 103\nMet some cool Minnesotans, but really\nSome of y'all need a lesson from Lazerbeak\n\n[Outro]\nI rock that\nRock that, rock that\n(Baby)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37c0b5808aa6f6664f7e7a919e7b1141.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
