Slam the door to they apartment\nThat sucky wife is pregnant with another sucka ass kid\nI'm askin' \"When will it end?\", waiting on that meteor shower\nTo rain down and bring all these suck niggas to they final hour\n\n[Hook]\nDon't tell us to slow it down, we won't listen\nWe're twenty-somethings and it's 20-something\nGreenrooms, drugs and liquor and hip hop\nWe're twenty-somethings and it's 20-something\n\n[Outro]\nRumors that world gon' end don't faze me\nI'mma get faded, I'mma get faded", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b2144cb0612a60ea9dbf3368e1272d4f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
