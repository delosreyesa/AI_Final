Been up in this thing so long, I'm like a sleeve\nCovering, I'm outchea, please don't be deceived\nRoll me up? Nigga please! Don't be presumptuous\nI packed you up for lunch and I ate you, you were scrumptious\nLiteral or not, I'm rambunctious, you yellow belly munchkins\nAin't that something? With your oompady-doo like\n\"Ding dong, the witch ain't dead, you better look out 'fore she chop yo' head!\"\nBreaking bread with the queens at the dinner table\nLapdogs eat scraps if you're able\nMaybe throw you a bone if I feel like it\nMaybe give you some steak if the mood right\nRight now, homie, bow down\nLooking at my head like my head need a crown\nCrown on the rocks, nigga, weed in the box, nigga\nGive me if you got figures, what I want's a lot bigger!\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nTo me, to me, to me, to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nLizzo be eating though, Lizzo be hungry\nLizzo Big GRRRL Small World till it ain't funny\nSay my name three times like I'm in destiny\nYo-ho-ho and a bottle of Four Loko\nChillin' with my niggas in the back like mane\nCame a long way, umbrellas for the rain\nIf you came this far, you better play the game\nBecause success and fame be two different things\nI remember being sad about boys and stuff\nBut that was way back in middle school\nNow I'm making crowds make noise and stuff\nAnd all my people back home like, \"who knew?\"\nNormally I don't like to toot my own horn\nCause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks\nBeing a rapper these days ain't what it seems\nMan, really you ain't making all the big bucks, but I'm killin' it\nI'm just saying that I'm feeling the wheeling one would experience\nWhile wheeling and gripping the wheel and gettin' it\nAnd my limericks be the same thing that get me on the cover, trick!\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nTo me, to me, to me, to me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37c0b5808aa6f6664f7e7a919e7b1141.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
