Wouldn't touch 'em with a 50-foot pole, even Pep\u00e9 Le Pew said no\nI'm a playa, I don't let nobody take my shine\nI get mine, you could feel me like my [?] around\nWe gettin' down all the way till the sun come up\nSippin' all the purple all out the white cup\n\n[Hook] (x2)\nHow ya like me now cause I'm real?\nHow ya like me? How ya like me now cause I'm real?\nHow ya like me? How ya like me now cause I'm real?\nTouch down, piece and chain, fool, shiny grill\n\n[Bridge]\nHuh, you know I love it, mane\nUh, you know I love it, mane\nYeah, love it, mane\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese fickle, fickle niggas holdin' out for a pretty penny\nYou swallowin' the truth and now you wizzin' like it's Henny\nI'm \"run, Forest, run\"-ing and my instincts be Jenny\nJenny Craigin' on them boys, I cut the fat and keep the skinny\nHere's a skinny on them motherfuckers that get caught up\nYeah, you tryna be the man and ya pushin' ya luck\nAnd you frontin' like we homies then you call me like I owe thee\nWhat about the shit you owe me like the time I spent with yo' ass for free?\nYou really think I'd waste my time with you?\nBuilding a business relationship if the shit gon' sink?\nNigga, that's how you really feel? Nigga, that's how you think?\nThink again next time ya come steppin' to me\nCause I wasn't put on this earth to sing back up for you\nEspecially if you gon' be selfish and not come through\nAnd I told yo' ho ass partner \"Go fuck off\" too\nSo we know why I don't fuck around with you\nAnd I hope it burns in yo' stomach cause Lizzo on the rise\nAnd I won't respond to yo' e-mails like \"Duh\", surprise\nAnd I don't hold grudges but, boy, ya cut off\nAnd, I mean, you got a little bit of talent but that's not enough\nAwwww maannn\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a183837b902bdd56491dcd0407bdead5.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
