Why else has this happened?\nOne man alone\nCannot suffice, I\u2019ve done the research\nIgnore the role\nInside my bed, your lion features (no!)\nYou can't lay on my shoulder\nThere are spikes and scales\nAnd your cheek would just depress me\n(In) a heavy haze, we love it\nLove the taste of it, (you clench your jaw)\nWe love it, (you love it!)\n\n[Bridge]\nHumanize me, baby\nHumanize me, baby\nI try!\n\n[Hook]\nI try to try, I, I (see the love through)\nI try to try, and see the love through human eyes\nWho's gonna open the door?\n\n[Break]\n(By your side standing)\n(I will be there by your side standing)\n\n[Chorus]\nI try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes\nI try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes\nI try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes\n(Humanize me, baby, ooh!)\nI try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes\n(Humanize me, baby)\n\n[Outro]\nYou smell so good\nYou\u2019re broke\nBroken", "image": "https://images.genius.com/083228ed7a239dd932ca8cb680e02656.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
