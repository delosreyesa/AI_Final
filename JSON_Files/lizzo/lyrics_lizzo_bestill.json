Be Still\n\n\nThis is God's will peace be still\n\nCan I fall in love before the world ends?\nCan my record get a few major spins? I'm saying\nI don't wanna think about tomorrow because i'm still hustling\nUntil then, i guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings\nNo raisins in the sun, just Funyins and a Sunkist, we up in the club making it mist\nLike a missed alcohol (though i see it every night)\nAnd that tylenol i take everyday period like midil\nBye y'all, i'm moving on to other things by y'all\nBut not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall\nLet the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like Obama and Biden\n\nAll my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills\nAll my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal\nWe're tight (psych!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37c0b5808aa6f6664f7e7a919e7b1141.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
