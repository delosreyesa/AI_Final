Put them down when its tough\nAnd tie those loose ends to make them meet\nEverything is gravy when your people live down the street\n\nI see ya, so wait\u2026\nTake this before you escape\nDon\u2019t make the past feel like a mistake (repeat)\n\nSwirling, black abyss\nStardust misting, raining down\nShining like the gems of eternity\nFormulating for me and mine\nPerhaps one day we can mine\nThrowing all those minerals and chemical elements\nInto the pot\nUh-oh we\u2019re getting hot\nThrough some sun on the stove top\nClose the lid, beware of the pop\nOf the splash back\nAdd a dash of that acid\nVoila\nOne day we\u2019ll show our kids what we did the Big bang\n\n\nDearly beloved, we\u2019re gathered here today\nWitnessing something that we cannot explain\nDearly departed, we\u2019re gather here today\nWitnessing something that we cannot explain\n[repeat till end]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37c0b5808aa6f6664f7e7a919e7b1141.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
