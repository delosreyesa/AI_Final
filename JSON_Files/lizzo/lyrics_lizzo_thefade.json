How can I\nHow can I make you feel when I don't even feel myself?\nNot saying I'm not cocky but I know when it come to the flow\nI will outdo myself, boom boom bang\nThey ain't the best cause they ain't in they lane\nHow can you try to be something you're not?\nThat is not art, girl please explain\nCut out the middle man, be instrumental\nI'm not the one to play the second fiddle\nBach off my show kid, I'm tryna make Mozart\n(I ain't seen the back of my eyelids in like a week)\nGuess I gotta run it\n\n[Hook] (x2)\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Ah-ah-ah-ah!\nI felt the fade (x8)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/70c0ec1728e90136bd1d6aa1b438908c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lizzo"}
