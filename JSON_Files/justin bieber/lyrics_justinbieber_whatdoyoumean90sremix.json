Oh, oh\nWhen you nod your head yes\nBut you wanna say no\nWhat do you mean? Hey-ey\nWhen you don't want me to move\nBut you tell me to go\nWhat do you mean?\nOh, what do you mean?\nSaid you're running out of time, what do you mean?\nOh, oh, oh, what do you mean?\nBetter make up your mind\nWhat do you mean?\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou\u2019re so indecisive, what I\u2019m saying\nTryna catch the beat, make up your heart\nDon't know if you're happy or complaining\nDon't want for us to end, where do I start?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFirst you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right\nWanna argue all day, make love all night\nFirst you're up, then you\u2019re down and then between\nOh, I really want to know\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat do you mean? Oh, oh\nWhen you nod your head yes\nBut you wanna say no\nWhat do you mean? Hey-ey\nWhen you don't want me to move\nBut you tell me to go\nWhat do you mean?\nOh, what do you mean?\nSaid you're running out of time, what do you mean?\nOh, oh, oh, what do you mean?\nBetter make up your mind\nWhat do you mean?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou\u2019re overprotective when I\u2019m leaving\nTrying to compromise but I can\u2019t win\nYou want to make a point, but you keep preaching\nYou had me from the start, won't let this end\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFirst you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right\nWanna argue all day, make love all night\nFirst you're up, then you\u2019re down and then between\nOh, I really want to know\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat do you mean? Oh, oh\nWhen you nod your head yes\nBut you wanna say no\nWhat do you mean? Hey-ey\nWhen you don't want me to move\nBut you tell me to go\nWhat do you mean?\n(I wanna know)\nOh, what do you mean? (Ooh)\nSaid you're running out of time, what do you mean?\n(Oh baby)\nOh, oh, oh, what do you mean?\nBetter make up your mind\nWhat do you mean?\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\n(This is ours baby, yeah)\nWhen you nod your head yes\nBut you wanna say no\nWhat do you mean?
