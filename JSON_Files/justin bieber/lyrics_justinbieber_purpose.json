But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren\u2019t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions\n\nYou can\u2019t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that\u2019s not who you are. You know you\u2019re trying to be the best you can be, but that\u2019s all you can do. If you don\u2019t give it all you got, you\u2019re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening\n\nThat\u2019s what happening with me, it\u2019s like \u201cGod, I\u2019m giving it all I\u2019ve got, sometimes I\u2019m weak and I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d And it\u2019s like I\u2019m not giving myself grace, I\u2019m just like understanding that\u2019s how it is", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a44b7eed00d8606ce78b65495f4d222.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
