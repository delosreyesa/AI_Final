Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah\n\n[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Justin Bieber]\nOh, I don't want a lot for Christmas\nThis is all I'm asking for\nI just wanna see my baby, yeah\nStanding right outside my door\nOh I just want you for my own, for my own baby\nMore than you could ever know\nMake my wish come true\nBaby all I want for Christmas is you baby\n\n[Outro until Fade: Justin Bieber]\nIt's all I want for Christmas baby\nIt's all I want for Christmas\nIt's all I want baby, yeah yeah\nWoah, woah woah woah woah, ooh baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d77f98a5a03d3510f87f28ef92d55a71.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
