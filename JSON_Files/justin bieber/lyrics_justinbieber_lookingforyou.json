It's time to go to the club\nTime to pull those toys out man skrr\nLet's do it\n\n[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]\nHey where the party at? Let's go, let's ride, Let's roll\nYeah, everywhere I go them girls follow, na, na, na, na\nLet everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door\nHey, pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nTonight might be the night\nYou might mess around and fall in love\nAnd then I might be the guy\nThat'll make you want to fall in love again\nGirl, what's your name? Happy that you came\nI'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose\nLooking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that\nI'll be looking for you\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nIs it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you\nI'm not paparazzi or a stalker\nShe right in front of me looking for you, looking for you\nNot the feds or a cop\n\n[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]\nI got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it\nAin't a problem baby girl, when you\u2019re winning\nTell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now\nGirl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning\nI think you're likin' what I'm sayin'\nDo I really gotta say any more?\nYou need to know that I ain't playin'\nBaby what are we waitin' for?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nTonight might be the night\nYou might mess around and fall in love\nAnd then I might be the guy\nThat'll make you want to fall in love again\nGirl, what's your name?

Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers\nMona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her\nTake her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa\nCut your man off little mama, you don't need him\n\n[Verse 4: Takeoff]\nYeen never seen a nigga like me\nHopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T\nIn the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats\nWould tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me\nI'm a vegetarian\nAll I want is some lettuce and some broccoli\nMansion out in Beverly\nYo bitch call me call me \"Your Majesty\"\n\n[Verse 5: Offset]\nMy bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage\nI run to the money like Forrest\nMy life is historic\nTravel 'round the world like I'm in orbit\nI take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon\nI watch her like a telescope\nI beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio\nI got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows\nI'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost\nI paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nTonight might be the night\nYou might mess around and fall in love\nAnd then I might be the guy\nThat'll make you want to fall in love again\nGirl, what's your name? Happy that you came\nI'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose\nLooking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that\nI'll be looking for you\n\n[Chorus: Quavo]\nIs it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you\nI'm not paparazzi or a stalker\nShe right in front of me looking for you, looking for you\nNot the feds or a cop", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/59f5894455d0ca87100454993e458f89.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
