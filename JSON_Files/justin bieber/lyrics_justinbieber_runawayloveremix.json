Raekwon\n\n[Verse 1: Raekwon]\nYou got stacks like the International House of Pancakes\nAll alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes\nPalms is wet, a don's regret\nNever to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck\nIt just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?\nBlinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap\nTake her, then we could slide to Jamaica\nShop for like a year or two, stop in Diego\nIt's obvious, I want to see who your mami is\nWe just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this\nFly walls, dinin' in fly halls\nCome to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall\nAll my money tied in knots\nStand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks\nBrazil cut sweater, Audi leather\nPlayin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta\n\n[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]\nYou see my baby up and hit the road\nWhere she's going? That's what nobody knows\nI need to find her 'fore another man does\nI wouldn't want him to steal my love\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nI'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool\nTryna be cool, what you expect me to do?\nI'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nI'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?\nSearching low and high, know that I'm not letting up\nI'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough\nI won't stop until I find my runaway love\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nLast name West and my teeth diamonds\nShe said \"Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?\"\nListen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on\nAccoutrements is Grey Poupon\nStuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis\nOpen up the door when you take her to the movies\nWhen you meet the parents, you tell De Niro\nHer boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo\nNext show, they gotta up the zeros\nNobody rockin' like this 16 years old\nThe hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me\nI'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me\nThe young youth, rockin' the gold tooth\nPull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to \"Cash Rules\"\nNo question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'\nThen say, \"You lookin' good, fly colored Asian\"\nRaw, I give it to ya, no trivia\nShe used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia\n'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs\nI guess that's the day she became a runaway love\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nI'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?\nSearching low and high, know that I'm not letting up\nI'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough\nI won't stop until I find my runaway love\n\n[Bridge: Justin Bieber]\nWhy can't I find you, love of mine\nWhen you're standing in front of my face?\nOh why, I must be blind?\nHow did I let you get away?\nHahah, yeah\n\n[Verse 4: Raekwon]\nLeave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly\nChillin' with two of my brothers\nWe both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set\nThis is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get\nTake that queen or shorty up\nWe can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up\nWakin' up, restin' in cold sweats\nThinkin' of this (bitch), the videotapes, even the stress\nMy mind is a terrible thing to waste\nNo love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss\nMe, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney\nJust like rockin' the old Ponys\nSo when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'\nI need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?\nTake your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine\nMy runaway love didn't mind, come on\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nI'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?\nSearching low and high, know that I'm not letting up\nI'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough\nI won't stop until I find my runaway love\nI'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?\nSearching low and high, know that I'm not letting up\nI'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough\nI won't stop until I find my runaway love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/395af2d20db5ab0d7e7e46f3cb44519c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
