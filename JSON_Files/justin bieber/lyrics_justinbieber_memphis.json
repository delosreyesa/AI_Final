If you love me, girl then say it\nSay what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby\n\n[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]\nI feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass\nShe give me butterflies and they won't go away\nUnder the stars, she took my hand and said\n\"I love you, need you, need you here to stay\"\n\n[Hook: Justin Bieber]\nI'd like to give you what you need\nI try but you're makin' it hard for me\nHow do I make you believe?\nCause I love you, need you, need you here to stay\nI'd like to give you what you need\nI try but you're makin' it hard for me\nHow do I make you believe?\nCause I love you, need you, need you here to stay\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nIs this what you want? The baddest\nI know what you want, without askin'\nI hit once, had to have it\nI hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic\nI heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress\nI just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?\nYep, real enough to go and get it tatted\nGive you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant\nI can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?\nIf you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it\nDon't you take my \"grant it\" though for granted\nI know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'\nAnd to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom\nMan I got her screamin' \"Finally Famous!\" when we fly around\nNever lie to you 'less I lie you down\nI put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown\nWe one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together\nThat's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer\nI swear, Sean Don\n\n[Hook: Justin Bieber]\nI'd like to give you what you need\nI try but you're makin' it hard for me\nHow do I make you believe?\nCause I love you, need you, need you here to stay\nI'd like to give you what you need\nI try but you're makin' it hard for me\nHow do I make you believe?\nCause I love you, need you, need you here to stay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9beb92057ef7b3e8a509612fcc97f9f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
