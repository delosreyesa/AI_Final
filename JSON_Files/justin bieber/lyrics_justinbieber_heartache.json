Wait\nBut yesterday we were\nI don't understand\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe started out it was perfect, nothing but fun\nAnd my heart was convinced to say that you're the one\nAnd I thought it would last for the rest of our lives\nBoy was I in for a big surprise\nWith no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool\nSame place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?\nFinally if I didn't make her cry\nShe wouldn't be with another guy\n\n[Chorus]\nNothing can cure my headache\nCause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak\nIt\u2019s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here\nI know but man just let me lay here\nCause this is something that I can't shake\nI must be experiencing what they call heartbreak\nThey say it's only just as worse as you make it\nI know but man just let me lay here\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door\nThe first time when you said, \"Forever I'll be yours\"\nStarted walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger\nWe made a promise\nAnd whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me\nBut it all came crashing down\nSitting in my room I got to get out of here\nWhat am I to do when I look up and you\u2019re not there, woah?\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nSay I'm too young for love\nI got so much life to live ahead\nBut, if only this is love I could get over\nI know I have to deal with the pain\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/890bdeeb58a5926865c0e251537c4e25.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
