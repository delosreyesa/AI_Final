How you gon' break me? I've been in this ish since diapers and babies\nAll my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies\nDreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy\nI need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?\nNever been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy\nWe the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting\nSave some and invest some, just let my money be patient\nIt's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant\nThey wish Satan tellers was in itthen they'd prey for me to be finished\nThem haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention\nAnd the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a07157096e8d69334e222552c6d9503.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
