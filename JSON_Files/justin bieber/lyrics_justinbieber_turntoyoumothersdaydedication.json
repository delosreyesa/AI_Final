There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way. And I know you will always be there for me\nSo when you\u2019re lost and you\u2019re tired\nWhen you\u2019re broken in two\nLet my love take you higher\n'Cause I, I still turn to you\nI still turn to you, I still turn to you\nIt was \u201994, the year that everything started to change, from before, You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways\n\nThen you found the Lord, You gave your life to Him, And you could not\nIgnore, the love he had for you, and I wanted more of your heart\n\nSo when you\u2019re lost and you\u2019re tired\nWhen you\u2019re broken in two\nLet my love take you higher\n'Cause I, I still turn to you\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d if you left me\nSo please don\u2019t go away\nEverything that you are is who I am\nWho I am today\nSo when you\u2019re lost and you\u2019re tired\nWhen you\u2019re broken in two\nLet my love take you higher\n'Cause I, I still turn to you. I still turn to you, I still turn to you\n\nTo you, to you, to you. I Still Turn to you. To you, to you, to you\nCauseI\nI turn to you", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ce1830fd6477acbb0187e8c849018032.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
