(I remember that)\nDon't knock your earrings (like yesterday)\nThey shine on me (we were little then)\nIn class daydreamed about you (my baby)\n(Just remember you) wow wow\nSince then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger\n\n[Chorus]\nI was a player when I was little\nBut now I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nA heartbreaker when I was little\nBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nAnd all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here\n'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger\nI'm bigger and you're bigger\nI was a player when I was little\nBut now I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nA heartbreaker when I was little\nBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nAnd all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here\n'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger\nI'm bigger and you're bigger, woah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/811d0c7c9048b690e3e3e0c3c46ab00e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
