I care but it's unfair\nI ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can\nIf it's real than its gon come back again\nSo I'm letting go, I hope you understand\nAll your friends say, he don't love you\nAnd the grown ups say its puppy\nLove ain't lust, It's more unlucky\nUntil you meet a diamond girl, now its sunny\nLoving you, it was us against the World\nYou my favourite girl, for you I would go to war\nI, take this all in just to show you\nOr maybe I'm just stuck in the moment\n\n[Justin Bieber]\nNow Romeo & Juliet\nBet they never felt the way we felt\nBonnie & Clyde\nNever had to hide like\nWe do\nWe do\n\nYou and I, both know it can't work\nIt's all fun and games\n'Til someone gets hurt\nAnd I don't\nI won't let that be you\n\nNow you don't wanna let go\nAnd I don't wanna let you know\nThat there might be something real between us two\nWho knew\nNow we don't wanna fall but\nWe're trippin' in our hearts\nAnd it's reckless and clumsy\nCause I know you can't love me here\n\nI wish we had another time\nI wish we had another place\nBut everything we have is stuck in the moment\nAnd there's nothing my heart can do\nTo fight with time and space cause\nI'm still stuck in the moment with you\n\nSee like Adam & Eve\nTragedy was our destiny\nLike Sonny & Cher\nI don't care\nI got you baby\n\nSee we both\nFightin' every inch of our fibers\nCuz ain't no way it's gonna end right but\nWe are both too foolish to stop\n\nNow you don't wanna let go\nAnd I don't wanna let you know\nThat there might be something real between us two\nWho knew\nAnd we don't wanna fall but\nWe're tripping in our hearts\nAnd it's reckless and clumsy\nAnd I know you can't love me here\n\nI wish we had another time\nI wish we had another place\nBut everything we have is stuck in the moment\nAnd there's nothing my heart can do\nTo fight with time and space cause\nI'm still stuck in the moment with you\n\nSee like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be\nBaby we both have the right to disagree\nAnd I ain't with it\nAnd I don't wanna be so old and gray\nReminiscing 'bout these better days\nBut convince just telling us to let go\nSo we'll never know\n\nI wish we had another time\nI wish we had another place\nCause everything we did\nAnd everything we have is stuck in the moment\nYeahhhh\n\nI wish we had another time\nI wish we had another place\n(Oh no no)\nBut everything we have is stuck in the moment\nAnd there's nothing my heart can do\n(Nothing my heart can do)\nTo fight with time and space\n(And space)\nI'm still stuck in the moment with you\n\nYeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15386c76e5e7666989a51a5b2f7e969f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
