Or were you not aware?\nWell you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere\nI'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile\nBut I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's gonna make you fall in love?\nI know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart\nDon't have to be scared at all, oh my love\nBut you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I can tell you're afraid of what this might do\nCause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose\nWell I don't want to lose it either\nBut I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWell did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?\nWell did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry\nCause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on\nAnd I hope by the time that I'm done with this song  I'll have figured out\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's gonna make you fall in love?\nI know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart\nDon't have to be scared at all, oh my love\nBut you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall\n\n[Bridge]\nI will catch you if you fall\nI will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall\nAnd if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me\nBut you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself\n\n[Chorus]\nFall in love\nI know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart\nDon't have to be scared at all, oh my love\nBut you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5316ebace7fc55a672caa8ac57ecdb9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
