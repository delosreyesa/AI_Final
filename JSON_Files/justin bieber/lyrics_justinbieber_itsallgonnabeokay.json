Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\nTell me, Do you love me?\nDo you need me? Do you want me back?\n'Cause I got you\nAnd I'll never let you go-go-go\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber]\nIt's all gonna be okay\nIt's all gonna be okay\nIt's all gonna be okay\nI'll be waiting for you\nBaby, if you take my hand\nBaby, if you take my hand\nWe can never go nowhere\nCan't you feel love in the air\nOh!
