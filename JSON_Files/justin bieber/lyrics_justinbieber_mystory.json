you\u2019re my life, my essence of life, in the love vortex i finally did fall\nMy darling, my angel, my sweetheart, my maiden, you will always be my porkydoll\nAnd I will be your satan\n\n[Hook]\nWe want the same thing, baby\nWe basically think the same\nHow could I ever be taken seriously?\nWith me wandering into your brain\nI hear you want to know if you are the one?\nIs that a question?\nOnly one simple thing is true\nI can draw straight line between the two of you\nThat's you, I'm hording here\nLiving with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer\nAs far as your question goes\nThere ain't no such thing as a one\nIt's one world, one life\nWe solemnly love\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey can't get what they are truly after, cause it's not you\nYou are my concern\nWe will genuinely go solid, he'll be too busy to focus on you\nThere are games I created to get to penetrate you\nBut it was my greed and selfishness, I hadn't a clue\nMy pursuit of you doesn't change in this manhood\nI was broke at the time\nYou told me Marshall make something out of your brokenness now, so I wrote this for you\nBut you don't want to read, that was the last thing on your mind too lou\nI'm not a comedian to just witter and not say a thing that I wouldn't mean, with every I mean, I mean\nI'm doing my best to get my life together so you find someone serious to settle with\nI'll get a clap for every time I crack a joke\nBut then too their will be serious glares for there ain't no shitty jokes with you\nAll those three things are in a sync so I'll sync in with the one who doesn't want to make you into a woebegone\nIt was all madness, it got me waddling off for macaroons\nI won't vulgarize this, it's like sugar on vanilla, it's amorous\nMy animus is vaporized\nI'm answerable to no one, it's being in supremo command\nI might have bit my tongue, but there is no suppressing thing for you\nI'll open up and shout it out, get wild, maybe hurt myself too\nIt's a bruise, not a Bruce, a Bruce wouldn't let that happen too\nI'd re-hydrate and keep saying all that happens till I die for you\nCall it magical when I'm with you, till then it's nothing but how wieners maim\nCheck your calender for tuesdays, Mardi gras is around the corner you might want to lurk in\nYou think you want to look marred and out, I can see they have surrounded you, climbing you on a pyre right there to burn you\nI'll take my boat to a marina and bring some water to put it out\nRelax, there ain't no fire, it's the fire within you\nIt's burning so fast that you can't even think about your stomach too\nIt's so painful to see you without any loving\n\n[Hook]\nWe want the same thing, baby\nWe basically think the same\nHow could I ever be taken seriously?\nWith me wandering into your brain\nI hear you want to know if you are the one?\nIs that a question?\nOnly one simple thing is true\nI can draw straight line between the two of you\nThat's you, I'm hording here\nLiving with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer\nAs far as your question goes\nThere ain't no such thing as a one\nIt's one world, one life\nWe solemnly love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb194c32ad750a40655f11685385d649.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
