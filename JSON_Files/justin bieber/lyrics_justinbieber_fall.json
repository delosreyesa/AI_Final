(in love)\nI know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart\nDon't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared)\nOh, my love\nBut you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall\n\n[Outro: Justin Bieber]\nI will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall\nI will catch you if you fall\nBut if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me\nBut you can't fly unless you listen,  let yourself fall", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f78103ada196b2a169e891c7f799d371.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
