I just wanna know\nHow come you act so different? Just talk to me I'll listen\nAll the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was out there on the road, life out of control\nShe became a victim to my busy schedule\nAnd I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care\nThis one's dedicated to the girl out there\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you always catch me at the bad time\nWhen I know you probably think it's a lie\nI know I told you last time was the last time\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\nFlatline, flatline\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\nCause when I hit you, you don't even reply\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNot breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?\nShe said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it\nIt's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me\nShut my heart down, now I don't know what I'mma do now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was out there on the road, life out of control\nShe became a victim to my busy schedule\nAnd I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care\nThis one's dedicated to the girl out there\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you always catch me at the bad time\nWhen I know you probably think it's a lie\nI know I told you last time was the last time\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\nFlatline, flatline\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\nCause when I hit you, you don't even reply\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\n\n[Bridge]\nGirl you always catch me at the bad time\nGirl you always catch me at the bad time\nI know I told you last time was the last time\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline, flatline\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl you always catch me at the bad time\nWhen I know you probably think it's a lie\nI know I told you last time was the last time\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\nFlatline, flatline\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?\nCause when I hit you, you don't even reply\nHow could you pull the plug and let me flatline?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ef5adacc33f592fd4ac6b893d6c6c7d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
