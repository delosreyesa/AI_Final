I can handle them\nNow he's bigger than me, taller than me\nAnd he's older than me and stronger than me\nAnd his arms a little bit longer than me\nBut he ain't on a JB song with me\nI be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill\nNo pun intended, was raised by the power of Will\nLike Luke with the force, if push comes to shove\nLike Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go\nI gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest\nLike David and Goliath, I conquered the giant\nSo now I got the world in my hand\nI was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]\nI will never say never, I will fight\nI will fight 'til forever, to make it right\nWhenever you knock me down\nI will not stay on the ground\nPick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up\nAnd never say never\nSay never\nI will never say never (never say it, never never say it)\nSay never\nI will fight to forever to make it right\nWhenever you knock me down\nI will not stay on the ground\nPick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never\n\n[Outro: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]\nNever say never, never say never, never say it\nNever say never and never say never, never say it\nNever say never, never say never, never say it\nAnd never say never\nNever say never and never say never (never say it)\nNever say never and never say never (never say it)\nNever say never and never say never\nAnd never say never", "image": "https://images.genius.com/215ed93b3969d180f169e9a2e3dbd669.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
