Stay tuned!\n\n[Verse 1]\n\n[Chorus]\nOpen your mind\nWider than the ocean\nLife is but a moment\nAnd every single time you wanna give up\nHold on tight to what you love, and don't let go\nAnd every single time you wanna break\nBreak from your troubles\nTake a breath, every step\nLet it wash away, wash away, ( oh, oh )\nOh, wash away\n\n[Verse 2]\n21 years ago, it's never ever been the same\nAnd all my life I never wanted to play the game\nI'm not the same as Michael even though the hall of fame\nI'm all hall of faith\nPut me on the wall of change\nI got a couple things I learned along the way\nFigured out how to mean what I say\nI just gotta be me...\n\n[Chorus]\nOpen your mind\nWider than the ocean\nLife is but a moment\nAnd every single time you wanna give up\nHold on tight to what you love, and don't let go\nAnd every single time you wanna break\nBreak from your troubles\nTake a breath, every step\nLet it wash away, wash away, ( oh, oh )\nOh, wash away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb194c32ad750a40655f11685385d649.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
