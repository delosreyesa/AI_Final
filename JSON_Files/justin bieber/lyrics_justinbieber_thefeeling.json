Am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\nI'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth\nBut sometimes the heart is deceiving\nCan't get out of my head and I need you to save me\nIf I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy\nIn love with you, am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\n\n[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]\nYou give to me\nEverything, anything that I could dream\nAnd at least that's what it seems\nCould it be I don't know what's good for me?\n\n[Refrain: Justin Bieber]\nI'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful\nInstead of hollow\nSugar on your lips, it starts to kill\nJagged like a pill, so hard to swallow\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]\nAm I in love with you? Am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\nI'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth\nBut sometimes the heart is deceiving\nCan't get out of my head and I need you to save me\nIf I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy\nIn love with you, am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\n\n[Bridge: Justin Bieber]\nI'm sinking faster and faster\nBetween heaven and disaster\nSorry if I make you feel like\nI'm standing on the borderline\n\n[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]\nAm I in love with you? Am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?\nI'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth\nBut sometimes the heart is deceiving\nCan't get out of my head and I need you to save me\nIf I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy\nIn love with you, am I in love with you?\nOr am I in love with the feeling?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a44b7eed00d8606ce78b65495f4d222.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Justin Bieber"}
