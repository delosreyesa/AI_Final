You wanna fall?\"\nSo I shout, \"Oh, I wanna get away from you\nAs fast as I can\"\nI tell my feet to move it\nI hope they have a plan\n\n[Chorus]\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nAre heading the right way\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nSaved my life today\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo now I'm free, free\nFrom the big bad giant\nWho was stalking me\nThank you feet, for guiding me, yeah\nI'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least\n\n[Chorus]\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nAre heading the right way\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nSaved my life today\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes I'm tempted, sometimes I am\nI would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man\nOh, he was the line between pleasure and pain\nBut me and the feet have some years to reclaim\n\n[Chorus]\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nAre heading the right way\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nSaved my life today\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nAre heading the right way\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nSaved my life today\n\n[Outro]\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nAre heading the right way\nThese little black sandals\nAre walking me away\nThese little black sandals\nSaved my life today", "image": "https://images.genius.com/69039246171b87edd2c86ba6197e5810.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "Sia"}
