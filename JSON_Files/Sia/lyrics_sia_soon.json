(Quickly)\nWhere are you? (Quickly)\nWhere are you?\nSoon I'll be cold and thirsty\nSoon I'll be cold and thirsty\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI'm hearing your last telephone call\nRinging louder and clearer than the rest\nI hear your invitation to see it all\nBetter written I am smitten no protest\n\n[Chorus 2:]\nWhere are you? (Quickly)\nWhere are you? (Quickly)\nWhere are you?\nSoon I'll be bored and lonely\nSoon I'll be bored and lonely\n\n[Verse 3:]\nLike a story well told\nYour conversation can hold me or soothe me\nLike a funny time to share you were there\nAnd your comfort and support me\n\n[Chorus 3:]\nWhere are you? (Quickly)\nWhere are you?\nSoon I'll be restless and weary\nSoon I'll be restless and weary\n\n[Bridge:]\nLike another man\nI want hold you within me\nLike a good day without care\nI just want you to last\nI just want you to last\n\n[Verse 4:]\nI'm tasting the last glass of your wine\nThe sweet taste linger left on lips\nI think of your kisses with mine\nThe sweet taste lingers left on lips\n\n[Chorus 4:]\nWhere are you? (Quickly)\nWhere are you? (Quickly)\nWhere are you?\nSoon I'll be sober and unkissed\nSoon I'll be sober and unkissed", "image": "https://images.genius.com/224efa4aa0a65a181b222c3e09527ada.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
