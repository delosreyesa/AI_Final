You can't change, can't change it\nJust 'cause I predicted this\nDoesn't make it any easier to live with\nAnd what's the point of knowin' it\nIf you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it\n\n[Chorus: Sia & Labrinth]\nTo be human is to love\nEven when it gets too much\nI'm not ready to give up\nTo be human is to love\nEven when it gets too much\nThere's no reason to give up\n\n[Outro: Sia]\nDon't give up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c0155c7f90d8fdda1bd456e27555fbe0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
