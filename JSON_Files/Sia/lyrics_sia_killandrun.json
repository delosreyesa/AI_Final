Should I love?\nYour poor lashes blow\nVictim of sensory love\nYou cry over my voice\nAn innocent call\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHide, oh the door\nSilent call for you\nWhat have I done to you?\n\n[Chorus]\nKill and run, kill and run\nI'm one of the dirty guns\nKill and run, kill and run\nA bullet through your heart\nKill and run, kill and run\nI'm one of the dirty guns\nKill and run, kill and run\nA bullet through your heart", "image": "https://images.genius.com/710ebd7ef7bb544215bd8dc64c72bced.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
