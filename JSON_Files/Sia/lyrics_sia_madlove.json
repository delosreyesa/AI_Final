Funny\nYou think you're so funny\n\nBut you hurt my feelings\nWe've had some good dealings\nWhat have I done recently\nTo make you so mean to me?\n\nI'm oversensitive you say\nBut I think you were nasty today\nYou make me feel nasty\nLike a control freak\n\nI just want to feel helpful\nLike I'm needed, a sense of reason\nYou tell your friends I'm a fucking kook\nLook how long it took\n\nI've been like this all the time\nYou don't know what it's like to be me\nYou're not paranoid, neurotic\nYou're free\n\nI don't like me much anymore\nYou make me feel a burden\nYou make me feel like a bore", "image": "https://images.genius.com/224efa4aa0a65a181b222c3e09527ada.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
