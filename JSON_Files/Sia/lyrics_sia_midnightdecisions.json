I can't, baby\nBut if you change your mind then I'll miss it\nNow I'm crying alone\nHotel, never much fun\nNot when there's nobody to catch your tears\nOut here\n\n[Chorus]\nI know\nLast night we made some midnight decisions\nDid I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't\nIt's all a blur when we talk through the liquor\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\n\n[Verse 2]\nSoothe me now, soothe me, old friend\nWarm my body, dunk my head\nHe was my whole world\nHe was my whole world\nKill the chattering\nKeep the voices from screaming\nHe was my whole world\nHe was my whole world\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI can't stop watching my phone\nCan't turn it off\nWhat is wrong with me? I can't, baby\nBut if you change your mind then I'll miss it\nNow I'm crying alone\nHotel, never much fun\nNot when there's nobody to catch your tears\nOut here\n\n[Chorus]\nI know, last night we made some midnight decisions\nDid I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't\nIt's all a blur when we talk through the liquor\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\n\n[Bridge]\nPull me out, I wanna fall\nFall into the rabbit hole\nJust pull me out, the pain is great\nThe pain of losin' you today\nThe minibar, my trusted friend\nNever thought we'd meet again\nBut here you are, one more, again\nYou're calling me\nYou're calling me\n\n[Chorus]\nI know, last night we made some midnight decisions\nDid I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't\nIt's all a blur when we talk through the liquor\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions\nI always regret midnight decisions", "image": "https://images.genius.com/767bb399fa84f8e2fbf538a92b89f882.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
