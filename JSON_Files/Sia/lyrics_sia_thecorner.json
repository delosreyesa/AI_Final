I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI live here on the corner, I am sucking in the fumes\nThese appear to my choices and they cannot be improved\nI'm all over the corner, all the pieces of my parts\nIt's time to mend the pieces of my broken heart\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou and I\nYou and I\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\n\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\n\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you\nWhat will I do? I cannot move\nYou are taking all that I knew\nHere I will stay, stuck in this place\nTrying to get over you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6bcd2bd1708eeae7282400f1e4be633f.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
