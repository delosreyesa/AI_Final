A glitch in your download?\nBut could it be an empty track, a lost melody?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBaby just burn we'll see\nI don't need you to believe in\nI've got a new faith in me, you'll see\n\n[Chorus]\nYou broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out\nYou tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating\nSee, I'm doing fine, better than fine\nAnd now I see that your melody was lost on me\n\n[Bridge]\nOh baby just burn we'll see\nI don't need you to believe in\nI've got a new faith in me, you'll see, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out (I'm doing fine without you)\nYou tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating (I'm doing fine without you)\nSee, I'm doing fine, better than fine\nAnd now I see that your melody was lost on me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/20b42b81df57a06cc9678c2300e63f78.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
