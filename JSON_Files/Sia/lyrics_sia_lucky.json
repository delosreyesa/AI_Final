Above!\n\n[Chorus]\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\n\n[Outro]\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nYeah I\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nI'm getting lucky tonight\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nYeah I\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nI\u2019m getting lucky tonight\nAnd so are you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/73ecd11c13b7dee2eede09e121ad2f6e.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Sia"}
