Is it good there?\nDoes it have lots of sun?\nIs it good there? Would it be really, really fun?\n\n[Outro]\nHe said \"I think it would be fun if we went there sometime\"\nHe said \"Let's go\"\nShe said \"Where?\"\nTo Mauritius", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55f89bf125ad2a9befa05ef606b8523e.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
