I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'\nThis ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant\nIt move, move, move, and you know it won't stop\nIt shake it like I'm pulled over by a white cop\nIt shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box\nTold 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts\nI be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch\nI get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence\nYou haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense\nAnd now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince\nTold 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle\nI'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle\nHe get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple\nAnd this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy\n\n[Interlude: Brooke Candy]\nBrooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX\nMiss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh\n\n[Verse 3: Brooke Candy]\nTell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy\nLittle bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy\nCocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' (Bounce)\n'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace\nAnd shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale\nMy pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail\nMy pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup\nI'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club\nHey, my ass is Magic City\nDouble D's, all-natural big titties\nShake it like a box-fresh vibrator\nAss first-class, fast like Concorde\nDamn, my ass so insane\nPut me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe\nYou can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate\nI'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyonc\u00e9\n\n[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]\n(Shake it, I shake it, I sh- I shake it)\n(I shake it, I sha- I shake it)\nOh darling, you say you don't know

dois T\nComo estagi\u00e1rio no trabalho, eu t\u00f4 sem tempo\nSe tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento\nDedinho na boca, sou uma tenta\u00e7\u00e3o\nA pista pega fogo derretendo o
