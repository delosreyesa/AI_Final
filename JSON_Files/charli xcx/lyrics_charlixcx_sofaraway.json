(so long ago, and so far away)\nI can't believe all those things that you said\nYou are the poison, I drank the poison\n\n[Verse]\nGet out my head, get out my bed\nI don't believe those three words that you said\nPocket of lies, crystal blue eyes\nHit the ground hard when I dropped from the skies\nYou're coming up when I'm going down\nNever in sync, so we just sank and drowned\nPress restart and reboot my heart\nBut I'm not a robot, so I fell apart\nBefore the moment we met, we were chatting on the internet\nGetting kinda close through the posts that we were looking at\nI was pretty confident, you were pretty into that\nI linked you to my music just to see if you'd be into it\nSo fuck the prologue, read the internet blogs\nGonna love this style and I came from the clubs\nI wasn't looking for a thug, I was looking for a bad boy\nBad boy, motherfucker, destroy\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't believe all those things that you said\nYou broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again\nSo I run... (so long ago, and so far away)\nI can't believe all those things that you said\nYou broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again\nSo I run... (so long ago, and so far away)\nI can't believe all those things that you said\nYou are the poison, I drank the poison\nI want the poison, I need the poison\nGimme the poison, I love the poison\nHooked on the poison\n\n[Interlude]\n(So far away...\nSo long ago, and so far away\nSo far away...\nSo long ago, and so far away)\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I know for sure that we've got to end this\nYou don't get no last kiss\n'Cause you're so damn crazy, and I'm so damn helpless\nSo don't text my number\nAnd don't call my mother\nI can't see your face now\n'Cause this is over\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't believe all those things that you said\nYou broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again\nSo I run... (so long ago, and so far away)\nI can't believe all those things that you said\nYou are the poison, I drank the poison\n(So long ago, and so far away)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dffaa41fa1c086b586a277f1a8657d4c.624x624x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
