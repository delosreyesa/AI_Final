Just like Lucy Liu\n[?], Is your lipgloss poppin'?\nWhen you walk into the club, is everybody watchin\u2019?\nYou make your own money? Are you independent?\nDo you pull up on your friends when you want somethin\u2019?\nDo you like [?], do you like sipping bottles?\nDo you like staying up till 5, getting into trouble?\nWhat\u2019s your instagram, about to follow you?\nWhat you doing after this, can I come too?\n\n(Chorus)\nAre you a bad girl? Cause you look super cute\nDo you ride around your city with your whole crew?\nDo you like fast cars? Do you like Subaru\u2019s?\nAre you a bad girl?
