Got so aggressive\nI know we meant all good intentions\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo pull me closer\nWhy don't you pull me close?\nWhy don't you come on over?\nI can't just let you go, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nOh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?\nI'm losing my mind just a little\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle?\nIn the middle\n\n[Bridge]\nLooking at you, I can't lie\nJust pouring out admission\nRegardless of my objection, oh, oh\nAnd it's not about my pride\nI need you on my skin\nJust come over, pull me in, just\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?\nI'm losing my mind just a little\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle?\nIn the middle, no no\nBaby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?\nOh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle?\nOh, in the middle\nBaby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?\nI'm losing my mind just a little\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?\nIn the middle, middle", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0626a29a3423021d9b66900870df482c.644x644x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
