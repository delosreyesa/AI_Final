How can I?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I? How can I?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIced out, got hot, bit the dust hardcore\nBut I\u2019m at the same place I was before\nYeah, I\u2019m in trouble\nCan\u2019t stop what\u2019s coming\nCan\u2019t blame this one on bad love\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHow can I? How can I?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I? How can I?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\n\n[Bridge]\nIt was boys and girls, and girls, and boys\nThe Southern Comfort from your comforter got destroyed\nIt was shady eyes with the violent noise\nWe on the graveyard digging where the love is void\nWe had a meltdown underground\nJust a cemetery chick, but it's over now\nBut I still taste your bones when I\u2019m all alone\nYou\u2019re the best I ever had, but now you\u2019ve got to go\nAnd now I\u2019m on my own\nI said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t go.\u201d\nPlease don\u2019t go\n\n[Final Chorus]\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I? How can I?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nI miss your touch and my skin on yours\nI want a taste of what I adore\nHow can I? How can I?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?\nHow can I? How can I?\nHow can I fix what I fucked up?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/79b709ba21595cb0fdafe59cad632959.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
