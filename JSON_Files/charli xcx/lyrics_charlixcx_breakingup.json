(Breaking up)\nBreaking up! (Breaking up)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou tried to pull this apart and make a brand new start\nYou tried to drive me to France, we didn't get very far\nYou said forever but baby I'm not so sure\nYou said you loved me (okay, let's rock)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fe34705c7af82886d5c883070b051bd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
