the three way\nPeep the video when I got it on replay\nNow can you make that ass go low?\nBring it right back real slow, uh\nI'm licking that cake off my face\nHe ask me can I put my brace?\nI know that you love how it tastes\nSo, bitch get me back that clean cut, yeah, yeah\nThey say I'm a slut, that's a compliment (that's right)\nAnd stealin' yo' girl's an accomplishment\nI take a boy, two at
