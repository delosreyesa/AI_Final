Jump on it!\nLike a trampoline\nThis lovin' is amazing, it came from outer space\nWe jump on it! Jump on it!\nLike a trampoline (like a trampoline)\n\n[Chorus]\nHold on closer\nSupernova\nYou make me so crazy, you make me so lazy\nAnd I will never be alone, never, never be alone\nMy supernova\n\n[Verse 2]\nCruising through the sky\nYeah we're shining so bright\nLovin' so hot, burnin' like the sunlight\nThey say that what we've got is wrong\nBut we're feeling alright\nWalk the world like a warrior, doing just fine\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAlways say you love me, keep on having fun\nWe jump on it! Jump on it!\nLike a trampoline\nWe're so high above the clouds\nYeah, we never touch the ground\nJump on it! Jump on it!\nLike a trampoline (like a trampoline)\n\n[Chorus]\nHold on closer\nSupernova\nYou make me so crazy, you make me so lazy\nAnd I will never be alone, never, never be alone\nMy supernova\nMy supernova\n\n[Bridge]\nNever be alone, never, never be alone\nNever, never, never, never, never be alone\nNever be alone, never, never be alone\nNever be alone, never, never be alone\n\n[Chorus]\nHold on closer\nSupernova\nYou make me so crazy, you make me so lazy\nAnd I will never be alone, never, never be alone\nMy supernova\nMy supernova\nMy supernova", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0626a29a3423021d9b66900870df482c.644x644x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
