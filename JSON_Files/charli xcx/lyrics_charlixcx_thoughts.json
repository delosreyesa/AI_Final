Did I fuck it up?\nAre my friends really friends now or are they far gone?\nOn the drugs at a bar, took 'em all\nCan't stop thinking 'bout you\n\n[Verse 1]\nFucked up, I just wanna break glass\nPhone calls, I just wanna talk back\nYeah, big attitude, just like a big stack\nBraindead for days, am I gonna relapse? Yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna talk\nI don't wanna smile, no, no\nGot a couple problems\nI don't wanna compromise, no, no (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm drivin' 'round in Hollywood\nI can only think 'bout you, you (Think 'bout, think 'bout)\nEverlasting pain and it weighs on my brain, like you\nDid I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?\nAre my friends really friends now or are they far gone?\nOn the drugs at a bar, took 'em all\nCan't stop thinking 'bout you\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't stop, I just wanna go fast\nNo sleep, I don't wanna relax\n10 planes in five days, I been 'round the world and back again\nMan I feel insane, I'm numb, can't stop the pain, no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna talk\nI don't wanna smile, no, no\nGot a couple problems\nI don't wanna compromise, no, no\n\n[Chorus]\nDrivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you\nEverlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you\nDid I fuck it up?\nAre my friends really friends now? Are they all far gone? (Yeah)\nOn the drugs at a bar, took 'em all\nCan't stop thinking 'bout you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d9836e8ffa5c07f567bdc78757492015.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
