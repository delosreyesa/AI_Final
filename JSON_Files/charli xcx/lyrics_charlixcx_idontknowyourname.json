Wanna run away?\nI wanna stick with you on a kiss and chase\nI can see me chilling at your place\nOnly one to be a distraction\nNow the only thing I see seems to be your face\nI wanna be the girl that keeps you safe\nI only meant tonight, but it must be fate\n\n[Chorus]\nI look to your eyes, they flicker like mine\nWe kiss in the rain\nI don't even know your name\nWe're soaring so high through thundering skies\nDo you feel the same?\nI don't even know your name\n\n[Refrain]\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nI don't even know your name\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nI don't even know your name\n\n[Bridge]\nI, I will not just fall in love, fall in love right here\nI, I can't fight this feeling, oh, feeling so lovesick\nOh, I really can't believe this, but it's so damn true\nSo much magic come between us\nNow I'm all for you\n\n[Chorus]\nI look to your eyes, they flicker like mine\nWe kiss in the rain\nI don't even know your name\nWe're soaring so high through thundering skies\nDo you feel the same?\nI don't even know your name\n\n[Refrain]\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nI don't even know your name\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nI don't even know your name", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0626a29a3423021d9b66900870df482c.644x644x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
