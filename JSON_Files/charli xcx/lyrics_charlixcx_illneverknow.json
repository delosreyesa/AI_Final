Will the sun melt down my bones?\n'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand\nI want to hold you close\nI'll never know\n1 2 3, oh!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm searching deserts and the morning skies\nJust to stare into your diamond eyes\nI'll build a rocket and I'll fly to space\nJust so that I can touch your picture perfect face\nOh, your picture perfect face, oh\n\n[Verse 4]\nI wonder if you'll do the same for me\nOr would you stay there and just let me be?\nAnd all my blood will drip the color of gold\n'Cause that's the love that runs for you within my soul\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what if I see you alone on the pavement?\nWill my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?\n'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand\nI want to hold you close\nI'll never know\nBut what if I see you alone on the pavement?\nWill my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?\n'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand\nI want to hold you close\nI'll never know\nWhen if I see you alone on the pavement?\nWill my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?\nAnd when I think of you my fingers are quicksand\nI want to hold you close\nI'll never know\n1 2 3, oh!\n\n[Instrumental Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0626a29a3423021d9b66900870df482c.644x644x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charli XCX"}
