Will I ever get you back?)\nKnowing that I never will forget\n(I won't forget, I won't forget)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat I was bein' such a fool\nAnd That I still don't deserve you\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna fall asleep\n'Cause I don't know if I'll get up\nAnd I don't wanna cause a scene\nBut I'm dyin' without your love\nBegging to hear your voice\nTell me you love me too\n'Cause I'd rather just be alone\nIf I know that I can't have you\n\n[Bridge]\nSo tell me what we're fighting for\n'Cause we know that truth means so much more\n'Cause you would if you could, don't lie\n'Cause I give everything that I've got left\nTo show you I mean what I have said\nI know I was such a fool\nBut I can't live without you\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't wanna fall asleep\nI don't know if I'll get up\nI don't wanna cause a scene\nI'm dyin' without your love\nBegging to hear your voice\nTell me you love me too\n'Cause I'd rather just be alone\nIf I know that I can't have you\nI don't wanna fall asleep (I don't wanna fall asleep)\n'Cause I don't know if I'll get up (Don't know if I'll get up)\nAnd I don't wanna cause a scene\nBut I'm dyin' without your love (Yeah)\nBegging to hear your voice (Begging to hear your voice)\nTell me you love me too (Tell me you love me too)\n'Cause I'd rather just be alone\nIf I know that I can't have you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/124fc36f71009d9a7b0febb1e8ee935c.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
