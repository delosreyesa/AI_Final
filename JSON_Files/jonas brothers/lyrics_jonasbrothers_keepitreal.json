Yeah\nHold on tight, don't you dare let go\nNow's the time to let the whole world know\nYou can shine bright, but still keep it real\n\n[Bridge]\nDid you ever think your dreams (Would become a reality?)\nAll you did was just believe\n\n[Verse 3]\nLivin' life, life in the fast lane\nNot that bad, no one can complain\nWho's to say that we won't keep it real?\nYeah\n\n[Chorus]\nLivin' life, life in the fast lane\nNot that bad, no one can complain\nWho's to say that we won't keep it real?\nHold on tight, don't you dare let go\nNow's the time to let the whole world know\nYou can shine bright, but still keep it real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c583d78c0466aa492fc0e88d62633c5.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
