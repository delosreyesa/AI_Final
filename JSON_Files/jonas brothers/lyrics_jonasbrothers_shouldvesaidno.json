Was she worth this?\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\nYou should've said no, you should've gone home\nYou should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go\nYou shouldn've known that word\n'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me\n\nYeah, and I should've been there in the back of your mind\nI shouldn't be asking myself why\nYou shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet\nYou should've said no, baby, and you might still have me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/656b21166aea94989243baf295a6388b.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
