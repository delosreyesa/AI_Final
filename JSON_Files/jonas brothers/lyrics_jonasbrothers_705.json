Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI was fine 'til 7:05\n'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life\nIf you're gone, I'll move on\nBut it only would have taken two seconds to say\nGoodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)\nGoodbye, whoa-oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe night after you're phone call\nMe and friends were hanging at the mall\nI was not believing what I saw, whoa\nHolding hands with him and sitting closer then six inches\nHoping she's not gonna kiss him now\nHow can I call you a friend? You stood me up in the end\nI know that it's over, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI was fine 'til 7:05\n'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life\nIf you're gone, I'll move on\nBut it only would have taken two seconds to say\nGoodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)\nGoodbye, whoa-oh\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't keep telling me that you're sorry now\nBut let me tell you how much this hurts me too\nYeah, oh\n\n[Chorus][x2]\nI was fine 'til 7:05\n'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life\nIf you're gone, I'll move on\nBut it only would have taken two seconds to say\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye, whoa-oh\nI was fine 'til 7:05\n'Til she walked out the door and right out of my life\nIf you're gone, I'll move on\nBut it only would have taken two seconds to say\nGoodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye)\nGoodbye\n\n[Outro]\nBut it only would have taken two seconds to say\nGoodbye (Goodbye), Goodbye (Goodbye), whoa-oh\nGoodbye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04359f291f8453c4cb4cde682e3d27de.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
