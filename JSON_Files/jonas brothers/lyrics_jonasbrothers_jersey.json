(where you goin\u2019?)\nWhen there's still\nSo much left to say\"\n\n[Bridge: Nick Jonas]\nTo each other\nIf we\u2019re broken\nRather be honest than unspoken\nWords they can hurt but\nWhat could be worse\nThan that final curtain come down\n\n[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]\nLike hey, where you goin'?\nDon't you want to talk about it\nBefore you walk away\nLike hey, where you goin'?\nWhen there\u2019s still\nSo much left\nStill so much left\nStill so much left to say", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a0664f9e26ea337869aaaf33fad53203.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
