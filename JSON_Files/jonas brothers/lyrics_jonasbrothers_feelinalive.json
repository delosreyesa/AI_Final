Crowd\nThey hear us all over the world\nHave you ever felt like standing on a rooftop\nHave you ever wanted to scream?\nEverybody dance, burn it up till we blast off\nJust like a rockin' machine (Yeah!)\n\n[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]\nHey!\nThis is the night!\nThis is the night!\nHey!\nI'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive\n\n[Bridge: Joe Jonas]\n'Cause we're not alone tonight\nSo raise up your hands and touch the sky\nCause we're not alone tonight\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\n[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]\nHey!\nThis is the night!\nThis is the night! (Yeah)\nHey!\nI'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive\nHey!\nThis is the night!\nThis is the night! (This is the night!)\nHey!\nI'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive\nHey!\nThis is the night!\nThis is the night!\nHey!\nI'm feelin' alive, feelin' alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/16e879e2b613cec3fef4ac07e47c0504.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
