(Can someone stop the noise?)\nI don't know what it is, but it just don't fit\nConsider me destroyed (Consider me destroyed)\nI don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head\nOh, I must be paranoid (Must be paranoid)\nI never thought it would come to this\nI'm paranoid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/576ae1e714c1cca54953dad56fbc072c.316x316x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
