Come back after this version comes out for the official lyrics!\n\n[Verse 1]\nNo, this isn't what I wanted\nI never thought it'd come this far\nThinking back to where we started\nAnd how we lost all that we are\nWe were young and times were easy\nBut I could see it's not the same\nI'm standing here, but you don't see me\nGive it all for that to change\nAnd I don't want to lose her\nDon't wanna let her go\n\n[Chorus]\nStanding out in the rain\nNeed to know if it's over\n'Cause I will leave you alone\nI'm flooded with all this pain\nKnowing that I'll never hold her\nLike I did before the storm\nYeah-ah-ah\nBefore the storm\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith every strike of lightning\nComes a memory that lasts\nAnd not a word is left unspoken\nAs the thunder starts to crash\nMaybe I should give up\n\n[Chorus]\nStanding out in the rain\nNeed to know if it's over\n'Cause I will leave you alone\nI'm flooded with all this pain\nKnowing that I'll never hold her\nLike I did before the storm\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm tryna keep the lights from going out\nAnd the clouds from ripping out my broken heart\nThey always say a heart is not a home\nWithout the one who gets you through the storm\n\n[Chorus]\nStanding out in the rain\nKnowing that it's really over\nPlease don't leave me alone\nI'm flooded with all this pain\nKnowing that I'll never hold you\nLike I did before the storm\nYeah, like I did before the storm", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c8f2a1a4958bf78bfa2a443a452ffa55.402x402x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
