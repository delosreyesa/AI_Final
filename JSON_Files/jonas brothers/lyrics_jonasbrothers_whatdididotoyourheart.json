(What did I do to your heart?)\nWhat did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)\nDid I break it apart?\nDid I break it, your heart?\nWhat did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)\nWhat did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)\nDid I break it apart?\nDid I break it, your heart?\n\n[Bridge]\n(What did I do to your)\n(What did I do to your) Heart\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat did I do to your heart?\nWhat did I do to your heart?\nDid I break it apart?\nDid I break it, your heart?\nWhat did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)\nWhat did I do to your heart? (What did I do to your heart?)\nDid I break it apart?\nDid I break it, your heart?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c583d78c0466aa492fc0e88d62633c5.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jonas Brothers"}
